# mhelp

Unofficial help file for commands, identifiers, on events, and other things.


NOTE: Multiple pages have formatting issues. They are slowly being worked on.


## Compiling

You will need to download the .chm help file compiler:

MD5: 53899BE5DA83419D772D5B97E653DA7C

Install it.

Open the "mhelp.hhp" file and click File -> Compile (or click the icon left of the sunglasses).

You can click the sunglasses icon to view the "mhelp.chm" file.

OR...

Run ```"C:\Program Files (x86)\HTML Help Workshop\hhc.exe" C:\path\to\mhelp.hhp``` in the command prompt.

## Editing

The HTML Help Workshop program is very primitive and buggy. You would be better off using a different text editor.


## Downloading

Check here for updates: https://github.com/RealKindOne/mhelp/tags

If you do not want to run the help file you can download the source code and open the .html files.
List of commands and identifiers can be found in ```commands.html``` and ```identifiers.html``` or you can search for the command/identifier filename.


## NOTE:

Windows has a security feature that prevents running non-installed (downloaded) .chm files. You will need to Unblock the file by Right clicking the .chm file, click Properties, Unblock, Ok.
