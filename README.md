# mhelp

Unofficial help file for commands, identifiers, on events, and other things.



## Compiling

You will need to download the .chm help file compiler:

MD5: 53899BE5DA83419D772D5B97E653DA7C


Install it.


Open the "mhelp.hhp" file and click File -> Compile (or click the icon left of the sunglasses).

You can click the sunglasses icon to view the "mhelp.chm" file.


## Editing

The Program is a bit primitive, I use a external editor for editing all the files. (Close out of everything if you edit any of the "mhelp" files.)
