<br>
The <b>/bwrite</b> command can be used to write a specified amount of bytes from the string/buffer to a given file starting at the start_pos position.

<br><b>Note:</b> the starting position is 0, not 1.

<H4>Synopsis</H4>
<pre class ="code">
/bwrite -act &lt;filename&gt; &lt;start_pos&gt; &lt;length&gt; &lt;text|&lt;%var&gt;|&binvar&gt;
</pre>

<b>Note:</b> If you pass a &lt;%var&gt; to /bwrite, if the content of that %var is a %variable itself, of if the first token of %var is a %variable itself, the content of %variable is used and no tokenization on %variable occurs, effectively preserving spaces. See the example below.

<H4>Switches</H4>
<b>-t</b> - Treats everything as plain text (i.e. $identifiers and &lt;%var&gt;iables (but not contents of %variables) are evaluated, but binary variables are not evaluated, are treated as text strings beginning with &) This switch is needed if literal string begins with & or string within %var begins with & or % characters.
<br><b>-c</b> - Chops the file at the end of the written data (if your current disk file is 10 bytes and you write 3 bytes at position 3 (4th byte), the resulting disk file's filesize is 6 because the 3 bytes were written as the 4th through 6th bytes of the file).
<br><b>-a</b> - Disables UTF-8 encoding of characters in the range 0-255, as long as the line contains no characters &gt; 255.

<H4>Parameters</H4>
<b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> - The file name to be modified.
<br><b>&lt;start_pos&gt;</b> - The position in the file to start writing at. First byte of the file is 0. Using -1 appends data to the end of existing file.
<br><b>[length]</b> - Length of the data to be written. Using -1 writes entire length of source text or variable.
<br><b>&lt;text|&lt;%var&gt;|&binvar&gt;</b> - Data to be written to the file.

<H4>Example</H4>
<pre class ="code">
; Write some text to a file at beginning of the file
/bwrite file.txt 0 hello there!
; Replace "there!" with "world!"
/bwrite file.txt 6 world!

//var %b a $chr(32) b | var %a % $+ b | bwrite -c test 0 -1 %a | loadbuf -a test
displays "a b" because the first token in %a is a variable (%b). Adding the -t switch would have instead written the literal string "%b".
