The <b>/dns</b> command resolves an address. If mIRC sees a "." in the name you specify it assumes it is an address and tries to resolve it. Otherwise it assumes it is a nickname and performs a <a href="userhost.html">/userhost</a> to find the user's address and then resolves it. If you specify an IP address, it looks up the host name. You can queue multiple /dns requests, and you can view the current queue by using /dns with no parameters.

<H4>Synopsis</H4>
<pre class ="code">
/dns [-46ch] [nick|address]
</pre>
<H4>Switches</H4>


<br><b>-4</b>
      - allows IPv4 results to be returned (enforce ipv4 for status window which are in ipv6 mode)
<br><b>-6</b>
      - allows IPv6 results to be returned (enforce ipv6 for ipv4-only machine, note that you can't connect to it, not so useful)
<br><b>-c</b>
      - clears all currently queued DNS requests, except for the one currently in progress
<br><b>-h</b>
      - forces /dns to treat the parameter as a hostname

<H4>Parameters</H4>


<br><b>[nick|address]</b>
      - the nick or address you want to look up
