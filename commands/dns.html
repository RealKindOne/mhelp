The <b>/dns</b> command resolves an address. If mIRC sees a "." in the name you specify it assumes it is an address and tries to resolve it. Otherwise it assumes it is a nickname and performs a <a href="userhost.html">/userhost</a> to find the user's address and then resolves it. If you specify an IP address, it looks up the host name. You can queue multiple /dns requests, and you can view the current queue by using /dns with no parameters.

<H4>Synopsis</H4>
<pre class ="code">
/dns [-46chmn] [name server] [nick|address]
</pre>

<H4>Switches</H4>
<b>-4</b> - Allows IPv4 results to be returned (enforce IPv4 for status window which are in IPv6 mode)
<br><b>-6</b> - Allows IPv6 results to be returned (enforce IPv6 for IPv4-only machine, note that you can't connect to it, not so useful)
<br><b>-c</b> - Clears all currently queued DNS requests, except for the one currently in progress
<br><b>-h</b> - Forces /dns to treat the parameter as a hostname
<br><b>-m</b> - Request A, AAAA, NS, MX, SOA, SRV, TXT records if available
<br><b>-n</b> - Forces /dns to use a specific [name server] IP address to resolve the address.


<H4>Parameters</H4>
<b>[nick|address]</b> - The nick or address you want to look up

<H4>Example</H4>
