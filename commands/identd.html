The <b>/identd</b> command can be used to enable or disable your Identd server in mIRC. Enabling the Identd server greatly increases the speed with which you connect to most modern IRC servers, in that the information the server requests, in order to identify your connection, is more readily available.

<H4>What Is Identd?</H4>

Identd is enabled as a server in order for mIRC to send your required Ident/Identification, which is part of the connection initiation to a lot of IRC servers. The server then checks to see whether you have an Identd running and uses the Ident (*UserID+System*) reported by that in your hostmask. If the server does not find Identd running on your machine, it adds the tilde (~) to your Ident.

<H4>Hostmask? Tilde (~)</H4>

The hostmask is combined with the information you see when you */whois* someone on an IRC server. It looks like the sample below:
<pre class ="code">
hostmaskhere@somewhere.com
</pre>

If Identd is not enabled on your client, or the client you try to */whois*, then the hostmask has a preceding tilde (<b>~</b>) attached to it, much like the sample below:
<pre class ="code">
~hostmaskhere@somewhere.com
</pre>
