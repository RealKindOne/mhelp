The <b>/tokenize</b> command replaces the existing $0 through $N'th tokens, filling $1 $2 ... $N identifiers with portions of a string, divided into tokens based on the location of the &lt;C&gt; delimiters. It also fills $0 with an integer containing the number of tokens filled from the string.

<H4>Synopsis</H4>
<pre class ="code">
/tokenize &lt;C&gt; &lt;text&gt;
</pre>

<H4>Switches</H4>
None

<H4>Parameters</H4>
<b>&lt;C&gt;</b> - The code point ($asc() value) 1-65535 of the character used as the delimiter (If the codepoint is not present within &lt;text&gt; the entire string is filled into $1).
<br><b>&lt;text&gt;</b> - The string of &lt;C&gt; delimited tokens which will fill the $N identifiers.

<H4>Example</H4>
Typing the following into the editbox returns a result:
<pre class ="code">
//tokenize 58 one:two:three | echo -a Result of $!2: $2
; $asc(:) == 58
</pre>
<pre class ="code">
Result of $2: two
</pre>
More examples using different delimiters:
<pre class ="code">
//tokenize 32 Hello, how are you? | echo -a Result of $!3: $3
; $chr(32) is a space
</pre>
<pre class ="code">
Result of $3: are
</pre>
<pre class = "code">
//tokenize 44 This is, a comma delimited, list. | echo -a Result of $!1: $1
</pre>
<pre class = "code">
Result of $1: This is
</pre>
Tokenizing follows the same rules as used by $gettok() and the other $*tok identifiers, where it strips leading, trailing, and consecutive delimiters. Consecutive delimiters does not result in a $null token:
<pre class ="code">
//tokenize 64 @1@@2@@3@@ | echo -a (1) $1 (2) $2 (3) $3 (4) $4
returns: (1) 1 (2) 2 (3) 3 (4)
</pre>
This means that tokenizing by other than space 32 can result in tokens having leading or trailing spaces causing tokens to be treated differently:
<pre class ="code">
//tokenize 46 1 .2 .3 | echo -a $len($2) / $asc($mid($2,2)) | echo -a $!2 value is $2 which is $iif($2 isnum,numeric, non-numeric)
returns: $2 value is 2 which is non-numeric
</pre>
<<b>Note:</b> because this is a /command not an $identifier, leading trailing or consecutive spaces are removed from &lt;text&gt; before (but not after) the tokenizing. But if tokenizing by 32, the leading and trailing spaces are also removed from the created $1 ... $N'th tokens.
<br>
<br>
Using /tokenize destroys the existing $1- tokens, so if you still need those, you should save them to a variable or use tokenize within another alias. If you use tokenize within an alias called from another alias, using tokenize does not affect the $1- values seen by the original alias.
<pre class ="code">
//tokenize 32 the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog | while ($1) { echo -a $1- | tokenize 32 $2- }

//tokenize 32 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 | echo -a changes from: $1- | if (. isin $2) tokenize 32 $1 $int($2) $3- | echo -a changes to: $1-
returns: 1.0 2 3.0 4.0
