/write
</H1>
<br>
<br>

The <b>/write</b> command can be used to manipulate a text file in various ways. Used without switches mIRC will append the line to the end of the text file. If the file does not exist, mIRC will create it. If &lt;words&gt;, &lt;wildcard&gt;, or &lt;regex&gt; contains spaces, they must be enclosed by a pair of quotes.

<H4>Synopsis</H4>
<pre class ="code">
/write [-cidnamN l&lt;line&gt; s&lt;words&gt; w&lt;wildcard&gt; r&lt;/regex/&gt;] &lt;filename&gt; [text]
</pre>
<H4>Switches</H4>


<br><b>-c</b>
      - Clears the entire file before writing to it
<br><b>-i</b>
      - Inserts the text at a given line instead of replacing it
<br><b>-d</b>
      - Deletes the given line
<br><b>-n</b>
      - Prevent adding $crlf at the end of the text
<br><b>-a</b>
      - Appends the text to an existing line
<br><b>-l</b>
      - Line number for the line to write/modify/delete
<br><b>-s</b>
      - Operates on a line which start with <words>
<br><b>-w</b>
      - Operates on a line which match the <wildcard> expression.
<br><b>-r</b>
      - same as -w - but uses a regular expression.
<br><b>-m</b>N
      - handle the $crlf addition before a line:
<pre class = "code">
   There is a difference in how /write behave vs /write -s or /write -w when it comes to adding a $crlf before your line, if mirc is going to add the line to end of the file and that the last line does not have a $crlf already.

   /write will always put the $crlf, whereas /write -ws won't. For compatibility and to allow you to control exactly when and if a $crlf is going to be added in this case:

   When N = 0, the current behavior is used, N = 1 means a $crlf is added only if a $crlf isn't always there, N = 2 means a $crlf is never added.
