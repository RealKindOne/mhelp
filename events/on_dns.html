<H1>On Dns</H1>
<br>
<br>
The <b>ON DNS</b> event triggers when a {{mIRC|/dns}} command query either succeeds or fails, including when a user does not exist on the server.

<H4>Synopsis</H4>
<pre>ON &lt;level&gt;:DNS:&lt;commands&gt;</pre>

<H4>Parameters</H4>
<br><b>&lt;level&gt;</b> - The corresponding {{mIRC|access levels}} for the event to trigger.

<br><b>&lt;commands&gt;</b> - The commands to be performed when the event listener's criteria is met.

== {{mIRC|local identifiers}} ==

=== {{mIRC|$dns}} ===

This identifier can be used to return all the address found.

=== {{mIRC|$iaddress}} {{mIRC|$naddress}} {{mIRC|$raddress}} ===

These return to the ip address, host address, and resolved address, respectively. Although these identifiers work now, it is strongly advised that migration to using the {{mIRC|$dns}} is made.

=== $nick ===

If {{mIRC|/dns}} was performed on a nickname rather than an address, then <a href="..\identifiers\nick.html">$nick</a><br> is filled with that nickname. Otherwise, <a href="..\identifiers\nick.html">$nick</a><br> is filled with your own name.


<H4>Example</H4>
Echo to the active window the results of the DNS:
<pre class ="code">ON *:DNS:echo -a $iif($1,$iif($dns(1).nick,$v1 has been resolved to) Hostmask: $dns(1).addr IP: $dns(1).ip,Could not resolve DNS query.)</pre>

The above example makes use of multiple {{mIRC|$iif}} to ensure that we get proper results, without unforeseen issues. The first surrounding {{mIRC|$iif}} checks to make sure any data has been returned. If no data is returned, then the {{mIRC|/dns}} obviously failed; therefore, we have it return a statement which says that a resolution could not be made. If data has been returned, the second {{mIRC|$iif}} checks to see if a '''.nick''' value can be extracted from the {{mIRC|$dns}}. This is filled if a nickname was the target of the {{mIRC|/dns}} request. If the nickname is filled, return the portion containing the nickname. If, however, the nickname is not present, only return the hostmask and ip address.
