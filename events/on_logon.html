<H1>On Logon</H1>
<br>
<br>
The <b>ON LOGON</b> event triggers immediately after mIRC has begun connection to a server, and has sent the standard [[Pass - IRC|PASS]], [[Nick - IRC|NICK]], and [[User - IRC|USER]] information to the server.

'''Note:''' This event can be prefixed with the '''^''' character to cause the event to trigger ''before'' the [[Pass - IRC|PASS]], [[Nick - IRC|NICK]], and [[User - IRC|USER]] information is sent to the server. Utilizing this '''^''' character, the events can even be [[/halt command - mIRC|halted]], and no information sent to the server; this will most-likely cause a connection interruption, or disconnection entirely.

<H4>Synopsis</H4>
<pre class ="code">
on &lt;level&gt;:logon:&lt;servername&gt;:&lt;commands&gt;
</pre>

<H4>Parameters</H4>
<br><b>&lt;level&gt;</b> - The corresponding <a href="..\other\access_levels.html">access levels</a> for the event to trigger.
<br><b>&lt;servername&gt;</b> - this parameter is based on the network name. If a network name cannot be found, it uses the group name, and if that cannot be found, it uses the server address as a last resort. Can be a <a href="..\other\wildcard.html">wildcard</a>. The order is important, for example if you use an ip address for this parameter and connect the first time, it will trigger, but mIRC will associate a network value and the network will be used next time, which wouldn't match the ip address, you can use * for this parameter and handle {{mIRC|$servertarget}} to tie the event to a specific server target value.

<br><b>&lt;commands&gt;</b> - The commands to be performed when the event listener's criteria is met.

<H4>Example</H4>
Echo to the active window some information before the login information is sent, using the '''^''' prefix:
<pre class ="code">on ^*:logon:*:echo -a Connecting to $server through the $network network...</pre>

Create a popup window which shows up after a successful connection is established:
<pre class ="code">on ^*:logon:*:noop $input(Successfully connected to: $server $+ !,io,Connection Successful)</pre>

The event above will generate a popup-window much like the one in the screenshot below:
