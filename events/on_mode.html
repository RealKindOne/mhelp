<H4>Example</H4>
Notice the channel when a user changes channel modes, and the local mIRC client is a channel operator:
<pre class ="code">ON @*:MODE:#:notice # $nick has modified the channel modes to: $1-</pre>

It is important to note that sending a channel notice to everyone at once is generally frowned upon unless one is an operator on the channel, or a bot has been instructed to do so.
