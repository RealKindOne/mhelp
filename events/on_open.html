<H1>On Open</H1>
<br>
<br>
The <b>ON OPEN</b> event triggers within mIRC when a specific window type is opened, either locally, through server interaction, or due to a scripted circumstance. This event can be used to trigger scripted situations for actions to perform when a certain window is opened.

Much like the [[On close - mIRC|ON CLOSE]] event, the '''ON OPEN</b> event triggers the {{mIRC|$target}} identifier, and fills it with the window name related to the event. During the '''ON OPEN''' events, {{mIRC|$target}} now refers to the window the event is dealing with.

<H4>Synopsis</H4>
<pre>ON &lt;level&gt;:OPEN:<?|@|=|!|*>:&lt;matchtext&gt;:&lt;commands&gt;</pre>

<H4>Parameters</H4>
<br><b>&lt;level&gt;</b> - The level for the event to trigger.

'''<?|@|=|!|*>'''</span>The window type that the event should trigger for:

<br><b>?</b> - Private messages/query windows.

<br><b>@</b> - [[Custom Windows - mIRC|Custom @windows]]

<br><b>=</b> - DCC Chat windows.

<br><b>!</b> - DCC Fileserv windows.

<br><b>*</b> - All window types.

'''&lt;matchtext&gt;'''</span>The text that should be matched. Can be a {{mirc|wildcard}}. Specifically for this event, this text will most-likely be from a private message query window opening up. The reason is that this will allow interaction with the text, during the event of a query window opening, immediately, rather than waiting for an [[On text - mIRC|ON TEXT]] event to trigger.

<br><b>&lt;commands&gt;</b> - The commands to be performed when the event listener's criteria is met.

== Examples ==
<pre class ="code">; When a query window opens, recognize if
; the user has typed the !yourserver command, which will
; relay to the user the current server for the mIRC client

ON *:OPEN:?:!yourserver:msg $nick Current IRC Server: $server $+ .</pre>
