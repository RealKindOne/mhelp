<H1>On Open</H1>
<br>
<br>
The <b>on OPEN</b> event triggers within mIRC when a specific window type is opened, either locally, through server interaction, or due to a scripted circumstance. This event can be used to trigger scripted situations for actions to perform when a certain window is opened.

Much like the <a href="on_close.html">On_Close</a> event, the <b>on OPEN</b> event triggers the <a href="..\identifiers\target.html">$target</a> identifier, and fills it with the window name related to the event. During the <b>on OPEN</b> events, <a href="..\identifiers\target.html">$target</a> now refers to the window the event is dealing with.


<H4>Synopsis</H4>
<pre class = "code">on &lt;level&gt;:OPEN:&lt;?|@|=|!|*&gt;:&lt;matchtext&gt;:&lt;commands&gt;</pre>

<H4>Parameters</H4>
<b>&lt;level&gt;</b> - The corresponding <a href="..\other\access_levels.html">access levels</a> for the event to trigger.
<br><b>&lt;?|@|=|!|*&gt;</b> - The window type that the event should trigger for:
<br><span style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>?</b> - Private messages/query windows.
<br><span style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>@</b> - <a href="..\other\custom_windows.html">Custom window</a>
<br><span style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>=</b> - DCC Chat windows.
<br><span style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>!</b> - DCC Fileserv windows.
<br><span style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>*</b> - All window types.

<br><b>&lt;matchtext&gt;</b> - The text that should be matched. Can be a <a href="..\other\wildcard.html">wildcard</a>. Specifically for this event, this text will most-likely be from a private message query window opening up. The reason is that this will allow interaction with the text, during the event of a query window opening, immediately, rather than waiting for an <a href="on_text.html">On_Text</a> event to trigger.
<br><b>&lt;commands&gt;</b> - The commands to be performed when the event listener's criteria is met.
