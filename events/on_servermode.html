<H4>Parameters</H4>
<br><b>&lt;level&gt;</b> - The level for the event to trigger.

<br><b>&lt;#[,#]&gt;</b> - Thechannel, or channels, to match the event listener. Can also be a {{mirc|wildcard}}.

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: 105px;"
|-
! Target !! Description
|-
| # || Can remain '''#''', to target all channels, or be a specific channel name.
|-

|}

<br><b>&lt;commands&gt;</b> - The commands to be performed when the event listener's criteria is met.

<H4>Example</H4>
Notice the channel when the server changes channel modes, and the local mIRC client is a channel operator:
<pre class ="code">ON @*:SERVERMODE:#:notice # $nick has modified the channel modes to: $1-</pre>

It is important to note that sending a channel notice to everyone at once is generally frowned upon unless one is an operator on the channel, or a bot has been instructed to do so.
