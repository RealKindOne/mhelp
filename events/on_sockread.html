<H1>On Sockread</H1>
<br>
<br>
The <b>ON SOCKREAD''' triggers when there is info waiting to be read on the specified TCP socket connection. You can read this info using the {{mIRC|/sockread}} command.

'''Note''': If this event triggers but no {{mIRC|/sockread}} is performed to attempt to read the buffer, it is assumed that no script exists that is handling this buffer, so it is cleared and the info it contained is lost.

<H4>Synopsis</H4>
<pre>ON &lt;level&gt;:SOCKREAD:&lt;matchtext&gt;:&lt;commands&gt;</pre>

<H4>Parameters</H4>
'''&lt;matchtext&gt;'''</span>The name of the socket you want the event to trigger on.

<br><b>&lt;commands&gt;</b> - The commands to be performed when the event listener's criteria is met.

== Connection State ==

It's important to check the value of {{mIRC|$sockerr}} to determine if any connection errors occurred and handle that case. Here is a list of possible values returned by $sockerr in the on SOCKREAD event:

* '''0''' - Data received correctly.
* '''3''' - Error occurred on connected socket: $sock($sockname).wsmsg will contain a more specific error message.

== Examples ==

You can find more information and examples in the {{mIRC|/sockread}} command page.

Here is a basic outline:
<pre class ="code">
on *:sockread:example:{

  ;if an error occurred ($sockerr is not 0)
  if ($sockerr) {
    echo -s An error occurred: $sock($sockname).wsmsg
  }

  ;no error occurred ($sockerr was 0)
  else {

    ;perform commands related to reading the data

    ;declare %r as a local variable for use in /sockread
    var %r

    ;read a line into %r from the buffer (this variable is subject to mIRC's Line Length Limit - see the /sockread page for more information)
    sockread %r

    ;do things with %r, such as checking its value or extracting parts to output later

  }
}
</pre>
