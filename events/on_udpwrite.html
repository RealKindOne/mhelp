<H1>On Udpwrite</H1>
<br>
<br>
The <b>ON UDPWRITE</b> is an event which was added in mIRC with UDP, but never has been documented. The event was meant to be used as the {{mIRC|on sockwrite}} event for TCP, however the actual design ended up being that:
* on sockwrite triggers for UDP socket if no error happened
* on udpwrite will trigger if an error occurred.


<br><b>Note:</b>This behavior was changed for consistency and backward compatibility in mIRC 7.33:
* on udpwrite is no longer triggered.
* on sockwrite triggers for UDP socket regardless of the error state.


== Writing more ==

It is possible that the data hasn't sent successfuly, especially with UDP, you should be checking for error with <a href="..\identifiers\sockerr.html">$sockerr</a> before trying to do anything, here is a list of the possible value for $sockerr in the on UDPWRITE event:

* '''0''' - The data has been written sucessfuly.
* '''3''' - Error occurred while trying to send the data, $sock().wsmsg will contain a more specific error message.

<H4>Example</H4>

<pre class ="code">
on *:udpwrite:name:{
  if ($sockerr) { echo -s An error occured while trying to read data: $sock($sockname).wsmsg | return }
}
</pre>
