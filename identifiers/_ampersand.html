The <b>$&</b> identifier is a construct which allows you to break up long, single script lines in order to make editing and reading them much easier.

<b>$&</b> can touch the end of your line and still be valid, but after $&, only spaces can follow. mIRC will just evaluate the custom identifier $& otherwise.

If it does not touch the line, the space before it will count as character.

<H4>Example</H4>
An alias that breaks up a long echo into multiple lines
<pre class ="code">alias testit {
  echo -a This is a really long$&
    line that is broken up because $&
    mIRC supports it! It can touch the end the line$&
    and still work
  echo -ag $len(a $
  b) is 3
}</pre>

Create an alias that has a code block similar to a programming language
<pre class ="code">alias testit {
  if ($me isin $+(Hello, $me,! How are you?)) $&
    {
    echo -a This code block resembles some popular programming languages.
  }
}</pre>
