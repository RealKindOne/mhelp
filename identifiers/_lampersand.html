The <b>$&</b> identifier is a construct which allows you to break up long, single script lines in order to make editing and reading them much easier.

<br><b>Note:</b> $& can touch the end of your line and still be valid, see the example

<H4>Example</H4>
An alias that breaks up a long echo into multiple lines
<pre class ="code">alias testit {
  echo -a This is a really long$&
    line that is broken up because $&
    mIRC supports it! The cool thing is $&
    that mIRC will also format these $&
    indentations within the script editor!
}</pre>

Create an alias that has a code block similar to a programming language
<pre class ="code">alias testit {
  if ($me isin $+(Hello, $me,! How are you?)) $&
    {
    echo -a This code block resembles some popular programming languages.
  }
}</pre>

Added: mIRC v5.5 (08 Jan 1999)
<H4>Notes</H4>
Non-spaces are not permitted following it on the same line, and this reports there is no such identifier (unless you create a custom identifier named '&')
//echo -a foo $& bar
