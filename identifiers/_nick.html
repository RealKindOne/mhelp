<b>=$nick</b> is a special identifier as it is prefixed with an equal '=' sign. <br>
=$nick is equivalent to = $+ $nick and is there for convenience.<br>
This format can be used to send a message to a <a href="..\events\on_chat.html">Dcc Chat</a> or <a href="..\events\on_serv.html">Dcc Serv</a> window.<br>
If you don't prefix the nickname with an equal sign, the message is sent as a private IRC message.

=$nick

<H4>Examples</H4>
<pre class ="code">
; message an user back in a DCC chat when they type: !myaddress [N], where [N] is a number, 0-9, of their address mask.
ON *:CHAT:!myaddress *: {
  ; Set the %num variable to whatever comes after !myaddress
  var %num = $2
  ; Verify that %num is a number, greater than or equal to 0,
  ; and less than 10 (0-9) since those are the only available
  ; options for $address(Nick,<N>).
  if ((%num isnum) && (%num >= 0) && (%num < 10)) {

    ; Using the =$nick identifier, a message is sent to the
    ; user, with their address mask utilizing the number mask
    ; they have requested.
    msg =$nick !myaddress Result: $address($nick,%num)
  }
}
</pre>
Now, any user in a DCC Chat can type: '''!myadress 3''', and it would return their address masked in the form of: *!*Nickname@provider.net
