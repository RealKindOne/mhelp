<b>=$nick</ is a special identifier. Inside the <a href="..\events\on_chat.html">On_Chat</a> and <a href="..\events\on_serv.html">On_Serv</a> events, if you want to send a message to the dcc chat/serv window rather than to send a message as a private message on IRC, you have to prefix the nickname with the equal sign '='. For convenience =$nick can be used as a shortcut for = $+ $nick, where $nick is evaluated properly.

<pre class ="code">
; Event messages a user back inside of a DCC Chat
; when they type: !myaddress [N], where [N] is a number, 0-9, of
; their address mask.

ON *:CHAT:!myaddress *: {

  ; Set the %num variable to whatever comes after !myaddress
  var %num = $2

  ; Verify that %num is a number, greater than or equal to 0,
  ; and less than 10 (0-9) since those are the only available
  ; options for $address(Nick,<N>).
  if ((%num isnum) && (%num >= 0) && (%num < 10)) {

    ; Using the =$nick identifier, a message is sent to the
    ; user, with their address mask utilizing the number mask
    ; they have requested.
    msg =$nick !myaddress Result: $address($nick,%num)
  }
}
</pre>

Now, any user in a DCC Chat can type: '''!myadress 3''', and it would return their address masked in the form of: *!*Nickname@provider.net
