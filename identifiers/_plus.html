<h1>$+</H1>
<br>
<br>

The <b>$+</b> is the [[concatenation]] [[concatenation operator|operator]] in [[mIRC]]. The operator can join together two strings end-to-end. In addition to its normal behavior, the $+ operator has a few special functions when used within {{mirc|evaluation brackets}}.

In its normal use, the $+ operator can be used to join together two strings end-to-end. For example:

<pre class ="code">
echo -a A $+ B $+ C
</pre>

Will result in:
  ABC
Likewise, the $+ operator can be used with identifiers and {{mirc|variables}} as well:

<pre class ="code">
var %x = A, %y = B
echo -a %x $+ %y $+ $day
</pre>

Will print (depending on the day of the week):
 ABMonday

This identifier also accepts any number of parameters. The above code can be rewritten (with the same result) as:
<pre class ="code">
var %x = A, %y = B
echo -a $+(%x, %y, $day)
</pre>
