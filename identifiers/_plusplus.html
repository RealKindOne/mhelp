<h1>$++</H1>
<br>
<br>
The <b>$++</b> is a very old construct, similar to <b>$+</b> concatenator, which allowed a 'delay' to the $+ behavior.
The example :

" $+ $read c:\test.txt $++ "

can be found in the changelog of mIRC, suggesting that if that $+ were used instead of a $++, it would concatenate the " to the filename before the file could be read but nowadays the above example works with $+ and $++

However $++ does differ from $+, inside brackets. As you may know, $+ inside bracket evaluation [ ] is not really behaving like it is outside them, $++ will act as though $+ was used, but it will behave the way $+ does outside the bracket evaluation, for example [ $ $++ me ] will produce plain text $me instead of [ $ $+ me ] producing your nickname
