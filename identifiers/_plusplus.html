<h1>$++</H1>
<br>
<br>
<b>$++</b> is a very old construct, similar to <b><a href="_plus.html">$+</a></b> concatenator. <br>
Behave the same as <b>$+</b> outside <a href="/other/eval_brackets.html">evaluation brackets [ ]</a>. Inside evaluation bracket, it's not. There is no real practical purpose to this identifier.
  
<h4>Synopsis</h4>
$++
<h4>Parameters</h4>
None
<h4>Properties</h4>
None

<h4>History</h4>

<b>$++</b> was added at a time where bracket evaluation [ ] did not exist and some identifier such as $read where not using parenthesis for parameters (called legacy syntax).<br>
There's only one mention of it in versions.txt for mIRC 4.1:<br>

<i>Added $++ identifier which works the same as the $+ identifier but does the concatenation after the previous item has been evaluated, so something like this works now: /say " $+ $read c:\test.txt $++ "</i><br>

Using " $+ $read c:\test.txt $+ " at the time would cause the legacy $read syntax to consume the second <b>$+</b> to build the filename, which would be expected.<br>
Resulting in <b>$read</b> trying to read from file c:\test.txt" with the lone quote included, resulting in error.<br>
This is where <b>$++</b> would cause $read to stop and read from file c:\test.txt correctly, and only applies the concatenation with the " after.<br>

<b>$++</b> works on version 4.1 and will fix the issue but the next version of mIRC was 4.5, and it introduced bracket evaluation.<br>
on mIRC 4.5 both " $+ $read test.txt $+ " and " $+ $read test.Txt $++ " will result in the line being read from the file being enclosed in quotes, and both crashes right after that.<br>
If the changelog for mIRC 4.1 was saying that it was now possible to quote a line with <b>$++</b>, the changelog of mIRC 4.5 was now saying that bracket evaluation should be used, no more mention of <b>$++</b>, just regular <b>$+</b>:<br>
<i>/notice $nick " $+ [ $read [ -s + [ $parm1 ] ] c:\text\note.txt ] $+ "</i><br>
After 4.5 they both behave correctly with the result being quoted line. and the legacy syntax is made to stop consuming <b>$+</b> or <b>$++</b> so it wasn't possible to read from a dynamically built filename until <b>$read()</b> was added.<br>
So <b>$++</b> was introduced as a way to stop the $read legacy syntax from consuming <b>$+</b> to be able to get the concatenation done after <b>$read</b> finished, and it worked for only one version, after that it was made to behave like <b>$+</b>, with exception to inside evaluation bracket<br>

<h4>Outside evaluation bracket</h4>
Outside evaluation bracket, it does not matter if you use <b>$+</b> or <b>$++</b>, they both behave as <b>$+</b>, at least there's no known case where <b>$+</b> and <b>$++</b> behave differently, but the legacy syntax stops at both as mentioned above:<br>

<pre class ="code">
//write -c test ok | write -c test.txt ok1 | echo -ag " $+ $read test $+ .txt vs " $+ $read test $++ .txt <br>
</pre>

outputs "ok.txt vs "ok.txt showing that <b>$+</b> and <b>$++</b> both concatenated after the previous item was evaluated, both read the file test instead of test.txt

<h4>Inside evaluation bracket</h4>
Inside brackets evaluation, <b>$++</b> does differ from <b>$+</b>. As you may know, <b>$+</b> inside bracket evaluation is not really behaving like it is outside of them.<br>

The [ A $++ B ] format does not achieve anything, it evaluates A and B once the same as A $+ B.<br>

The A [ $++ B ] format does not achieve anything, it evaluates A and B once, same as A $+ B, however, if you have anything after in the line, it will break, where <b>$+</b> does not:<br>

//echo -ag A [ $++ B ]<br>
  works<br>
vs<br>
//echo -ag A [ $++ B ] a<br>
  * Break: evaluation error<br>

The [ A $++ ] B format is similar to A [ $++ B ] except that it will only work with no B:<br>
[ A $++ ]<br>
  works, will evaluate A once<br>
[ A $++ ] B<br>
  * Break: evaluation error<br>

It is worth noting that if you're using the format [ A $+ ] B which has <b>$+</b> instead of <b>$++</b> after A, which is a buggy format propagating the non evaluation of token outside the [ ] bracket, you can reset the [ ] behavior with <b>$++</b>, sort of:<br>
//echo -ag [ $!!!!!!me $+ ] $!!meB $+ $!!meC $++ $!!meD $+ $!!meE<br>
outputs $!!!me$!!meB$!!meC$meD$!!meE<br>
This get $!!meD evaluated twice while $!!meE is back to evaluation 0 with the <b>$+</b>, so the carried over behavior of [ ] are still there, but <b>$++</b> force an evaluation somehow.<br>
