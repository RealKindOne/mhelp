<h1>$++</H1>
<br>
<br>
<b>$++</b> is a very old construct, similar to <b><a href="_plus.html">$+</a></b> concatenator. Behave the same as $+ outside [ ] bracket evaluation. Inside [ ], it's not. There is no real practical purpose to use this identifier.

<h4>History</h4>

$++ was added at a time where bracket evaluation [ ] did not exist and some identifier such as $read where not using parenthesis for parameters (called legacy syntax).
There's only one mention of it in versions.txt for mIRC 4.1:

<i>Added $++ identifier which works the same as the $+ identifier but does the concatenation after the previous item has been evaluated, so something like this works now: /say " $+ $read c:\test.txt $++ "</i>

Using " $+ $read c:\test.txt $+ " at the time would cause the legacy $read syntax to consume the second $+ to build the filename, which would be expected.
Resulting in $read trying to read from file c:\test.txt" with the lone quote included, resulting in error.
This is where $++ would cause $read to stop and read from file c:\test.txt correctly, and only applies the concatenation with the " after.

$++ works on version 4.1 and will fix the issue but the next version of mIRC was 4.5, and it introduced bracket evaluation.
on mIRC 4.5 both " $+ $read test.txt $+ " and " $+ $read test.Txt $++ " will result in the line being read from the file being enclosed in quotes, and both crashes right after that.
If the changelog for mIRC 4.1 was saying that it was now possible to quote a line with $++, the changelog of mIRC 4.5 was now saying that bracket evaluation should be used, no more mention of $++, just regular $+:
<i>/notice $nick " $+ [ $read [ -s + [ $parm1 ] ] c:\text\note.txt ] $+ "</i>
After 4.5 they both behave correctly with the result being quoted line. and the legacy syntax is made to stop consuming $+ or $++ so it wasn't possible to read from a dynamically built filename until $read() was added.
So $++ was introduced as a way to stop the $read legacy syntax from consuming $+ to be able to get the concatenation done after $read finished, and it worked for only one version, after that it was made to behave like $+, with exception to inside evaluation bracket

<h4>Outside evaluation bracket</h4>
Outside evaluation bracket, it does not matter if you use $+ or $++, they both behave as $+, at least there's no known case where $+ and $++ behave differently, but the legacy syntax stops at both as mentioned above:

//write -c test ok | write -c test.txt ok1 | echo -ag " $+ $read test $+ .txt vs " $+ $read test $++ .txt

outputs "ok.txt vs "ok.txt showing that $+ and $++ both concatenated after the previous item was evaluated, both read the file test instead of test.txt

<h4>Inside evaluation bracket</h4>
Inside brackets evaluation, $++ does differ from $+. As you may know, $+ inside bracket evaluation is not really behaving like it is outside of them.

The [ A $++ B ] format does not achieve anything, it evaluates A and B once the same as A $+ B.

The A [ $++ B ] format does not achieve anything, it evaluates A and B once, same as A $+ B, however, if you have anything after in the line, it will break, where $+ does not:

//echo -ag A [ $++ B ]
  works
vs
//echo -ag A [ $++ B ] a
  * Break: evaluation error

The [ A $++ ] B format is similar to A [ $++ B ] except that it will only work with no B:
[ A $++ ]
  works, will evaluate A once
[ A $++ ] B
  * Break: evaluation error

It is worth noting that if you're using the format [ A $+ ] B which has $+ instead of $++ after A, which is a buggy format propagating the non evaluation of token outside the [ ] bracket, you can reset the [ ] behavior with $++, sort of:
//echo -ag [ $!!!!!!me $+ ] $!!meB $+ $!!meC $++ $!!meD $+ $!!meE
outputs $!!!me$!!meB$!!meC$meD$!!meE
This get $!!meD evaluated twice while $!!meE is back to evaluation 0 with the $+, so the carried over behavior of [ ] are still there, but $++ force an evaluation somehow.
