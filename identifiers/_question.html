The <b>$?</b> identifier can be used to ask for user-input
<br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> This identifier use the old format (legacy syntax) to pass parameter and is deprecated, it has been replaced with <a href="input.html">$input</a>. 

<H4>Synopsis</H4>
<pre class ="code">
$?="[Input Request Message]"<br>
$?*="[Input Request Message]"<br>
$?!="[Input Request Message]"<br>
$?#="[Input Request Message]"<br>
$?N="[Input Request Message]"<br>
</pre>
Displays an input box (dialog) to get user-input. The "Input Request Message" is optional, if not specified, it default to "Enter reply:"

  
<H4>Parameters</H4>
<h3>Type</h3>
This identifier differs even from typical legacy syntax which use next token as the parameter like <b>$read</b>, and use a different identifier name to pass the type of user input.
<br><b>$?</b> Displays an input request with an editbox -- return the content of the editbox
<br><b>$?*</b> Displays an input request with a passworded editbox, the input is treated as a password field: each character is shown as a '*' -- return the real content of the editbox
<br><b>$?!</b> Displays an input request with a Yes & No button instead of an editbox (and instead of Ok & cancel buttons) -- return <a href="true.html">$true</a> if you click on <b>Yes</b>, otherwise (including not clicking on <b>No</b> but escaping away) it returns <a href="false.html">$false</a>
<br><b>$?N</b> Where N is a positive number >= 1, representing the $N identifier, If the value of $N is $null, you are asked to provide a value as though you used $iif($N != $null,$N,$?), otherwise $N is returned.
<br><b>$?#</b> If the value of $chan is $null, you are asked to provide a value as though you used $iif($chan != $null,$chan,$?), otherwise $chan is returned
<h3>Text</h3>
After the Type * ! N or #, you can pass an equal sign '=' followed by a quoted string, representing the text appearing inside the dialog.<br>
You can use <a href="crlf.html">$crlf</a> to display multiple lines.
<br><br>
This identifier fills the <a href="_exclamation.html">$!</a> identifier with the same value returned by the identifier itself<br>

<h4>Notes & quirks</h4>

The $? identifier has some parsing issues, it has been replaced by <a href="input.html">$input</a> to overcome these issues:<br>

If you don't pass the ending quote with the input message parameter, the script is halted. <br>

$? can be used without the '=' sign as long as you either don't pass an input request message (just $?), or that this parameter contain a balanced number of quotes:<br>

$? $?"test" $?"test words" etc are all valid usages.<br>

 In fact, mIRC start looking for a valid parameter when you start the first quote, regardless of if you used '=' or not, $?ignored"this is the message" will actually ignore the part before the first quote<br>

* //echo -a $?"message with multiple words" $?!"test"
This line cause parsing issue, here $?!"test" is evaluated before, mIRC seems to get lost as to which quote is closing which quote, and end up evaluating more than it should

<H4>Example</H4>
<pre class ="code">
;Echoes whatever the user types into the input field to the active window.
alias testme {
  echo -a $?="Type something for me"
}
;use password field
alias testme {
  echo -a $?*="Enter Password:"
}
;use yes/no button
alias testme {
  echo -a $?!="Do you like chocolate?"
}
;will ask you to type something because $3 is not set
alias testme {
  tokenize 32 A B
  echo -a $?3
}
</pre>
