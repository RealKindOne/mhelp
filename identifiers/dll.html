The <b>$dll</b> identifier call a function of a dll, and eventually returns a value if the function is made to return a value. More information about dll <a href="..\other\dll.html">here</a>.


<H4>Synopsis</H4>
<pre class ="code">
$dll(name[.dll],procname,data)
</pre>
<H4>Parameters</H4>
<b>name.dll</b> - the filename to the dll. If filetype not used, assumes filename.dll
<br><b>procname</b> - procname, the name of the function in the dll
<br><b>data</b> - a text string/parameter passed to the function, which .dll sees as 0x00-terminated, even if procname does not require a data string, you must still pass a null or dummy string. If data should contain a comma, best to place it in a %var or use $chr(44) instead of trying to pass as a literal string.

<H4>Notes</H4>
Beginning v7.56, filename and filename.dll are both loaded into the $dll(N) list once as filename.dll. Previously they were loaded as 2 different $dll(N) items with 2 different filenames, yet referencing both filename|filename.dll used the memory image associated with the lowest Nth item in the $dll(N) list of the pair.
