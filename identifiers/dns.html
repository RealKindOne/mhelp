<br>The <b>$dns</b> identifier becomes filled and has the ability for reference whenever an <a href="..\events\on_dns.html">On_DNS</a> event occurs.

<H4>Synopsis</H4>
<pre class ="code">
$dns(N)[.property]
</pre>
<H4>Parameters</H4>
<b>N</b> - Used to reference the resolved address, or total number of addresses


<H4>Properties</H4>
<b>addr</b> - Return the resolved [[hostmask]] address
<br><b>ip</b> - Return the IP Address
<br><b>nick</b> - Return the nicknames used when <a href="..\commands\dns.html">/dns</a>'ing on a nickname

<H4>Example</H4>
Echo to the active window the results of the DNS:
<pre class ="code">ON *:DNS:echo -a $iif($1,$iif($dns(1).nick,$v1 has been resolved to) Hostmask: $dns(1).addr IP: $dns(1).ip,Could not resolve DNS query.)</pre>

The above example makes use of multiple <a href="iif.html">$iif</a> to ensure that we get proper results, without unforeseen issues. The first surrounding <a href="iif.html">$iif</a> checks to make sure any data has been returned. If no data is returned, then the <a href="..\commands\dns.html">/dns</a> obviously failed; therefore, we have it return a statement which says that a resolution could not be made. If data has been returned, the second <a href="iif.html">$iif</a> checks to see if a <b>.nick</b> value can be extracted from the <a href="dns.html">$dns</a> identifier. This is filled if a nickname was the target of the <a href="..\commands\dns.html">/dns</a> request. If the nickname is filled, return the portion containing the nickname. If, however, the nickname is not present, present only the [[Hostmask - IRC|hostmask]] and [[IP address|IP address]].
