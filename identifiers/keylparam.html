<b>0-15</b> -    The repeat count for the current message. The value is the number of times the keystroke is autorepeated as a result of the user holding down the key. If the keystroke is held long enough, multiple messages are sent. However, the repeat count is not cumulative.
<br><b>16-23</b> -	The scan code. The value depends on the OEM.
<br><b>24</b> -	Indicates whether the key is an extended key, such as the right-hand ALT and CTRL keys that appear on an enhanced 101- or 102-key keyboard. The value is 1 if it is an extended key; otherwise, it is 0.
<br><b>25-28</b> -    Reserved; do not use.
<br><b>29</b> -	The context code. The value is 1 if the ALT key is held down while the key is pressed; otherwise, the value is 0.
<br><b>30</b> -	The previous key state. The value is 1 if the key is down before the message is sent, or it is 0 if the key is up.
<br><b>31</b> -	The transition state. The value is 1 if the key is being released, or it is 0 if the key is being pressed.
