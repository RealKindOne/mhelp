<H1>$powmod</H1>
<br>
<br>
The <b>$powmod''' performs integer exponentiation over a modulus.
<br>
<br>
For integers (B,E,M) the remainder of B^E modulo M is a result that is a non-negative integer less than M, and can obtain the result even when the E exponent is large. Should be compatible with the Powermod function in Wolfram Alpha
<br>
<H4>Synopsis</H4>
<pre class ="code">
$powmod(B,E,M)
* Note: Unlike the % percent operator in $calc the result cannot be negative. If 'B' is negative, the result is calculated after casting 'B' to positive by adding 1-or-more multiple of the M modulus, so (-1,2,11) is the same as (10,2,11).
* If the exponent E is negative, the result of (B,-E,M) is obtained from ($modinv(B,M),+E,M), so $powmod(B,-1,M) is the same as $modinv(B,M) 
* Inputs should be integer, so fractions in any parameter are ignored.
* While most math identifiers support numbers as large as 2^53, care should be used for this function if using a modulus greater than $sqrt($calc(2^53)), because this algorithm uses an intermediate result which can potentially be as large as (M-1)^2. When in doubt, either use this function where a %var.bf name is involved or if /bigfloat ON mode is enabled.
* In spite of using a shortcut which allows obtaining results involving large E exponents without calculating the full result of B^E, the result can be very slow for very large numbers. The main factors affecting the time for non-trivial (B,E,M) are:
# Bit length of M
# Bit length of E
# Number of '1' bits returned from $base(E,10,2)

<H4>Parameters</H4>
* '''B''' - Integer Base of the exponentiation
* '''E''' - Integer Exponent
<br><b>M</b> - Integer Modulus over which the exponentiation is found
