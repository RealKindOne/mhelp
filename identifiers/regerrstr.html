<br>
<br>
The <b>$regerrstr</b> identifier returns the PCRE error string of the compile function for the last regex call made, if any.
<br>
A regular expression must be compiled first, and then it's executed against a string.
<br>
If an error occurs in the compile function, $regerrstr is filled with an error string, corresponding to a positive number (listed below), but only the string is returned.
<br>
$regex and similar regex functions reporting number of matches ($regsubex with output variable or $regsub) will report a value of -14.
<br>
This value actually comes from the exec function, this is for convenience. $regex etc always return a negative value when an error occurs.
<br>
-14 is supposed to mean an internal pcre error, but this is only the case if $regerrstr is not set, then. You can find more info about on the regex page
