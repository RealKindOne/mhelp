The <b>$sslhash</b> identifier returns the SSL certificates for the active connection, or $null if no active certificate

<H4>Synopsis</H4>
<pre class ="code">
$sslhash(&lt;method&gt;,&lt;type&gt;)
$sslhash(&lt;md5|sha1|sha256|sha512&gt;,&lt;p|s&gt;)
</pre>

<H4>Parameters</H4>
<b>&lt;method&gt;</b> - (md5, sha256, sha512, ecdsa)
<br><b>&lt;type&gt;</b> - p = client certificate, s = server certificate
<H4>Properties</H4>
<b>.babble</b> - Returns bubble babble string instead of hash digest
<br><b>.colons</b> - Returns hash digest with pairs of hex digits separated by colons
<H4>Example</H4>
<pre class ="code">
//echo -a The $server certificate shown in context menu of status window has sha1 fingerprint $sslhash(sha1,s).colons
//echo -a The client certificate used to connect to $server has sha512 fingerprint $sslhash(sha512,p)
</pre>
The fingerprint is shown for the certificate used to connect to the server, or $null if none, and does not change if editing configuration while remaining connected. This should match your own certificate fingerprint seen in the /whois command, if you use the matching hashname.
<p>
You can override the global certificate in serverlist, by unchecking 'use global certificate' and selecting a different filename. If that box is unchecked with no server certificate checked, then you are not seen by the server as using a certificate.
<p>
Your client certificate cannot be seen by the server unless you connect to a +port
<p>
MD5 is available because some server software uses it as the default when admins have not configured the fingerprint type used.
<p>
$sslcertsha1 and $sslcertsha256 remain valid but are removed from /help
<H4>Error Messages</H4>
* Invalid parameters: $sslhash
Caused by the 1st parm not being one of the 5 valid types, or the 2nd parm not being '<b>s</b>' or <b>p</b>
