<H1>$tempfn</H1>
<br>
<br>
The <b>$tempfn</b> identifier returns a temporary filename in the <a href="mircdir.html">$mircdir</a> using the same filename mask used by mIRC internally, such as for the <a href="..\commands\write.html">/write</a> command. Now accepts an optional pathname as an alternate folder location.
<H4>Synopsis</H4>
<pre class ="code">
$tempfn
$tempfn([path])
</pre>
<H4>Parameters</H4>
None
<br><b>[path]</b> - absolute or relative foldername for the temp file. If path not provided, default is $mircdir, and any path provided MUST exist. If Parenthesis is used is blank path, returns $null.
<H4>Properties</H4>
None
<H4>Example</H4>
<pre class ="code">
//echo -a $tempfn
</pre>

It does not create the disk filename, but offers the string as a "safe" filename that can be used without it already existing as a disk file or foldername.

The string returned is $mircdir $+ mirc $+ $rand(0,$calc(2^31-2)) $+ .tm_

'''Note:''' The filename mask is the same used internally by mIRC for disk write fuctions, such as in the /write command.
<pre class ="code">
//echo -a $tempfn(temp)
</pre>
Same except the string lists the filename's path as being in the temp subfolder beneath $mircdir. Halts with error if that foldername doesn't exist. Handles strings like ".." or "c:" or "\path" the same way as $findfile.

It is up to the user to use a folder where you have write permissions for actually creating the file. If D: is a DVD drive, $tempfn(D:\) returns a string containing D:\ as the path, even if the disk write would fail.
