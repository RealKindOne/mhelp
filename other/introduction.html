This article focuses on the very basics of mIRC Scripting. The target audience is people with no knowledge, or very limited knowledge, of the mIRC scripting language.

<H4>The very basics</H4>
Let's take a few moments to help familiarize you with the following key components:

<H4>Statements</H4>
Every script is composed of one or more statements. A statement describes something that needs to happen. Each statement must go on its own line, or it must be separated by a pipe, which is the '|' symbol.<br>
Every statement is evaluated first, and then executed.

If separated by a pipe, the pipe itself must have a space in front and a space after it, otherwise it's not seen as a delimiter of statements.<br>

For example, the following two are the same:
<a name="pipes"></a>
<H4>Piping</H4>
<pre class ="code">statement 1 | statement 2 | statement 3 | statement 4</pre>

<H4>Non-piping -- Multiline</H4>
<pre class ="code">statement 1
statement 2
statement 3
statement 4</pre>

<h4>Commands statements</h4>

Most statements are called "commands". Commands are performing some operations, without returning data to you.<br>
For example if you want to display a line inside a window in mIRC, you would use the <b>/echo</b> command.<br>
After a command follows its parameters, spaces delimited, some commands take no parameter.<br>
Because of this, all commands tokenize their parameters by spaces, meaning that double spaces are trimmed to a single space, while leading and trailing spaces are always stripped.<br>
mIRC scripting in general relies on the space character, it does not use quoted strings.<br>
However some commands have limited quoted string support, most of these commands support quoted string because their parameter is a filename or a window name, which can contain spaces.<br>
And finally, some commands have limited quoted string support because they actually require two string, both possibly containing spaces.<br>
Limited means that you cannot escape the quote character inside a quoted string, mIRC doesn't support escaping with backslash '\' or anything, and even for commands supporting quoted string, they don't support them anywhere but only for a given parameter or two.<br>
Commands' name can be built dynamically by using <b>$identifiers</b> and can be overwritten with aliases, see below for both.
  

<h4>Other statements</h4>
If a statement isn't a command as described above, it's a control flow statement such as <b>/if</b> or <b>/return</b>, they cannot be overwritten and must appear literally in the code<br>
Such statement can involve more syntactic elements and are used to control the logical flow of the code, branching etc<br>
They are also referred to as commands although they are parsed differently.<br>
One exception is the /var command, which has special parsing on comma.

<H4>What's with the slashes?</H4>
If you asked any script related question in a help channel, you were probably told to type some code that begin with a forward slash. That's because you can execute code directly in mIRC's editboxes, where you type to chat on IRC.<br>
In order to execute any code (statements) from the mIRC editbox, you must prefix the code with at least one forward slash character '/'.<br>
You may use two forward slash, the difference between using one or two forward slash is that with one, the rest of the line is not interpreted/evaluated, we will discuss this difference later.<br>
You cannot execute multiline code from the editboxes, you can only pipe statements (the editboxes also have a security which prevents you from starting a statement with non literal code such as an identifier or a %variable, but can be workarounded with bracket evaluation)<br>
You must use two slashes (evaluation) to get the pipe character recognized as a separator of statements but you only need the two slashes on the first statements.<br>
We usually refer to commands by prefixing them with a slash or two.

<h4>Routine</h4>
If you're not executing code from mIRC's editbox, your statements must be part of a routine.<br>
A routine can be:<br>
-a function, which has a name, functions are called aliases, they can be executed as a command by starting a statement with the name of the alias (custom command) but also as an identifier<br>
-an event, mIRC is an event-driven language, events are functions which are automatically called for you (callback) in some situations.<br>

<H4>Where does the code go?</H4>
All of your routine should go in the Script Editor. To open the script editor press-and-hold the &lt;ALT&gt; key on your keyboard, and then tap the R key (&lt;Alt&gt;+R). Alternatively, you can go to the Tools Menu -> Script editor.<br>
Below is a screen shot of the mIRC Script Editor:<br><br>

<img src="..\images\remote_menu.png"><br><br>

You will notice that there are five selectable tabs: <b>Aliases</b>, <b>Popups</b>, <b>Remotes</b>, <b>Users</b>, and <b>Variables</b>.<br>
Each type of script are stored into different files, an alias file can only have aliases in it, you can have multiple aliases file loaded.<br><br>
Popups are a special type of script file which describes a popup menu, popups are the contextual menu which appears when you right click some areas like the nicklist.<br>
There are 5 different popups categories: status, channel, query, nicklist, and menubar. <br><br>
Remote are the type of file you can contain both events and aliases at the same time. You can have multiple remotes file loaded.<br>
Users is for managing access level, while Variables is for storing global variables, only one file can be loaded for both of them.<br>

In the script editor, every commands are executed as though 2 slashes where used from the editbox, the line is evaluated before being executed, you cannot get statement from the script editor to be executed without evaluation happening (not without extra code anyway).

<h4>Aliases</h4>
Aliases are used to describe any piece of scripting code that can be reused. Aliases have a name by which we can refer to them, and they also have a body. <br>
The body of an alias contains a statement, or a list of statements, that execute(s) when we call that alias. You can think of aliases as custom commands.<br>
All aliases can be called from your edit box by preceding them with one or two forward-slashes, just like commands.
They have the basic following format:
<pre class ="code">alias &lt;name&gt; &lt;statements&gt;
</pre>If you use a remote file, you must prefix it with the <b>alias</b> keyword, space separated as shown above.
<br><br>
Example in a remote file with the alias prefix:<br>
<pre class ="code">alias helloworld echo -ag hello world</pre><br>
In this example the name of the alias is "helloworld" which you can execute by typing /helloworld, it would execute the echo command/statement, the echo command is taking three parameters, "-ag", "hello", and "world", which will echo "hello world" in the active window.<br>

<h4>Events</h4>
If your statements don't belong to an alias, the other thing they can used with are events. <br>
Events are basically predefined aliases which are called when something happen, such as a nickname joining a channel you're in.<br>
<br>

<b>Note:</b> Event (except menu event) and aliases are parsed the same when it comes to statements, everything that's being said below is true for events and aliases.<br>

<H4>/echo command</H4>
<pre class ="code">//echo Hello World!</pre>
/echo is one of the most used command in general, it can display a line of text in a window. When you are finished typing this echo command, hit Enter on your keyboard. You should see the following result
<br><br>
<img src="..\images\hello_edit.png"><br><br>

Recall we said earlier that multiple statements can be combined by using the pipe '|'? Let's print 3 lines to the screen using the echo command and some pipes. Type the following code into your editbox:

<pre class ="code">//echo Scripting | echo Is | echo Fun!</pre>

You should hopefully see the following results:<br><br>
<img src="..\images\fun_edit.png"><br><br>
Here the two slashes are required, otherwise the pipe character '|' won't be interpreted and the line 'Scripting | echo Is | echo Fun!' will be displayed.

<H4>Let's make it into an alias, shall we?</H4>

Let's make the code we used above to print "Scripting Is Fun!", and call this new alias "fun":

<pre class ="code">alias fun echo Scripting | echo Is | echo Fun!</pre>

<h4>Remote tab vs Aliases tab</h4>
<br>
<img src="..\images\fun_alias_remote.png">
<img src="..\images\fun_alias_alias.png">

<br><br><b>Note:</b> When you want to execute an alias, you would refer to it as wanting to ''call the alias''.

To call on our alias ''fun'', all we have to do is use its name, preceded by a forward-slash in any mIRC editbox:

<pre class ="code">/fun</pre>

That should print our text again:<br><br>

<img src="..\images\hello_edit.png"><br><br>

<b>Note: </b>We usually use two slashes from the editboxes because it enables evaluation/interpretation, so far we have only seen how evaluation affects the pipe character.
  
<h4>Conditional statement</h4>
<a href="conditional_statements.html">Conditional statements</a> allow you to create branches and loops, where statements only get executed based on a condition.<br>
This means that after a conditional statement, you'll have a group of statements, with one or more statements associated to the condition.

<h4>{ } and group of statements</h4>
Aliases and events also have a need to associate one or more statements to them, associating a group of statement is done by using a pair of spaced out { } around the statements.<br>
If the context allow it, you can omit using the pair of spaced out { } bracket around the statements:<br>
-For aliases and events, this is when you define them on a single line using pipe to separate the statements (we just did it above for the helloworld alias). This is because the single line ensures that all statements belong to the alias/event.<br>
-For conditional statement, that's when only a single statement is associated to the condition.<br>
However, using { } allows you to separate your statements using newline instead of a spaced out pipe, which is result in cleaner code when grouping statements together.<br>
We usually use newline for each new statement and we usually don't mix piping with newline although it's valid:
<pre class ="code">alias test echo -a test</pre> is equivalent to <pre class ="code">alias test { echo -a test }</pre> the same way <pre class ="code">alias test echo -a test | echo -a test1</pre> is equivalent to <pre class ="code">alias test { echo -a test | echo -a test1 }</pre> which is also equivalent to <pre class ="code">alias test {
  echo -a test | echo -a test1
}</pre> and to <pre class ="code">alias test { echo -a test |
  echo -a test1 }</pre> and to <pre class ="code">alias test { echo -a test |
  echo -a test1
  }</pre>

<br><br>
With conditional statement, the { goes after the condition:
<pre class ="code">alias fun if (1 == 1) echo Scripting | if (2 == 3) echo Is | echo = | echo Fun!</pre>
In the example above, the statement 'echo Scripting' belongs to the if (1 == 1) statement. The same is true for 'echo Is' belonging to 'if (2 == 3)', which, however, will not be echoed because the condition 2 == 3 is not true.<br>
Overall, the above example will echo: <pre>Scripting = Fun!</pre>
This is equivalent to:
<pre class ="code">alias fun { if (1 == 1) { echo Scripting } | if (2 == 3) { echo Is } | echo = | echo Fun! }</pre>
<br>
This should help you understand how { } brackets are used.<br>
Note that conditional statements are a bit special where not using { } can lead to problem if you're not using () around the conditional part.<br><br>

A few notes about the language limitations:

<br><br><span style="color: #DB0000;">The opening bracket " <b>{</b> " <b>must</b> be on the same first line of the alias/event definition</span>
<br><span style="color: #DB0000;">The opening bracket <b>must not</b> touch anything (space on its left, and space or newline on the right).</span>
<br><span style="color: #DB0000;">The closing bracket <b>must not</b> touch anything (space on its left, and space or newline on the right).</span>
<br>
<H4><span style="color: #256B22;">Right Examples</span></H4>
<pre class ="code">
  alias example { echo hello! }
  alias example {
  echo hello!
  }</pre>

<H4><span style="color: #9E1010;">Wrong Examples</span></H4>
<pre class="code">alias example{echo hello! }</pre>
The opening bracket is touching "example" and "echo".
<pre class="code">alias example { echo hello!}</pre>
The closing bracket is touching the "hello!".
<pre class="code">alias example
{
  echo hello!
}</pre>
The opening bracket must be on the same line as the "alias" keyword. 
  
<H4>Evaluation/Interpretation</H4>

Before we wrap up this tutorial, we need to talk about one last concept: evaluation.

Evaluation/interpretation is what happens to statements when you use two slash from the editbox or execute something from the script editor.
So far we've seen how the pipe character is used as a delimiter of statements on single line, as well as the { } delimiting group of statements belonging to the same alias/event/conditional statement.
Although we can't get this behavior from script in the script editor, using one slash from editbox will result in the pipe character as well as { and } being literal text.

<h4>$identifier & %variables</h4>

Your statement, and their parameters, if any, may be composed of $identifiers and %variables.

All identifiers starts with dollar symbol sigil '$'.
Generally speaking, identifiers are performing an operation like commands, but they return a value, some $identifiers are special constructs and don't return a value, they are used for various other operations.
Some identifiers can take parameters as well as properties.
Without any parameter nor any properties, the basic syntax is:
<pre class ="code">$name</pre> where name is referring to the name of an existing identifiers.
If they take parameters, they use the ( and ) and a comma to separate arguments, much like other programming language:
<pre class ="code">$name(&lt;argument 1&gt;, &lt;argument 2&gt;, &lt;argument 3&gt;, ...)</pre>
If they take a property, you must use () even if you don't pass parameters, they use a dot '.' at the end after the ')' followed by a known property name:
<pre class ="code">$name(&lt;argument 1&gt;, &lt;argument 2&gt;, &lt;argument 3&gt;, ...).property</pre>
When you create an alias, you can call it as a command by starting a statement with that alias name, but you can also make your alias return a value and call your alias as a custom identifier.<br>

If we want to print out our current nickname, we would use the following code:

<pre class ="code">//echo -a $me</pre>

%variables works exactly the same way as $identifier with no parameter (and no property) but they evaluate to a value that a script specifically set, which is the simplest way to store data. These are called "variables".<br>
<br><br>
Both can appear pretty much anywhere, inside other identifiers' parameter or parameter of a statement or event definition.<br>


<H4>$rand()</H4>
One of the most common operations we use is to generate random numbers. This is where the <a href="..\identifiers\rand.html">$rand</a> identifier comes into play; it can generate a random number between a given range. The $rand() has the following syntax:

<pre class ="code">$rand(&lt;low&gt;, &lt;high&gt;)</pre>

Given both low bound and high bound number values, $rand will return a random number in between, and including, the two numbers. For example:

<pre class ="code">alias random {
  echo The dice rolled on the floor .... $rand(1, 6)
}</pre>

Here is what we got when we called out /random alias a few times:

<br><br><img src="..\images\random_example.png"><br><br>
The results that mIRC generates for you will be different than the ones listed above in the screenshot; this is the nature of the $rand identifier.

<h4>$+</h4>
An example of an identifier that is a construct and not returning a value is $+, $+ is a concatenation operator, A $+ B results in AB. There is an real identifier version of it, $+(), which does return the concatenated value, $+(A,B,C) is ABC.

<H4>Comments</H4>
Comments are normal, readable text that can be placed inside of your script, and they are a good practice to help better explain to other scripters what's going on in your code. Technically speaking, a comment can say whatever you want it to say, and they are ignored when the program is executed, meaning they have no effect on the actual behavior of the code.

<H4>Single-line Comments</H4>
The most basic comment is the single-line comment, which has the following syntax:

<pre class ="code">; This is single-line comment.</pre>

Note on how the comment begins with a semicolon and ends at the end of the line; anything on this line is now ignored.

Here is another basic example of a single-line comment:
<pre class ="code">alias fun {
  ; print "Scripting"
  echo Scripting
  ; print "Is"
  echo Is
  ; print "Fun"
  echo Fun!
}</pre>

<br><img src="..\images\fun_comment.png"><br>

<br><b>Note: </b>The command REM can be used interchangeably with the semicolon. Do not try to comment out a single statement out of multiple statement separated by a pipe.

<H4>Multi-line Comments</H4>
The second type of comment is the multi-line comment. A multi-line comment can, as its name suggests, span multiple lines. Multi-line comments are enclosed between the <b>/*</b> & <b>*/</b> characters. The syntax for a multi-line comment is:

<pre class ="code">
if (/* iswm $1) /
/* This is
  a multi-line
  comment!
*/</pre>
Your text must go between the /* and the */ in order for it to be treated as a comment.<br>

A few notes about the language limitations:
<br>
<br>
<br><span style="color: #DB0000;">Text may touch the opening <b>/*</b> on the right; however, <b>/*</b> must start the line</span>
<br><span style="color: #DB0000;">The closing <b>*/</b> must be on a line of its own</span>
<br>Text is NOT indented unless placed inside curly brackets. The opening brace can be on the same line with the <b>/*</b> and the final comment line isn't indented if there's a closing brace on that line.

<H4><span style="color: #256B22;">Right Examples</span></H4>
<pre class ="code">/* testing
   out
   a multi-line
   comment
*/</pre>
or
<pre class ="code">/*
   testing
   out
   a multi-line
   comment
*/</pre>
In both of the above examples, the opening comment parameters are properly executed,
the lines are spaced out and the closing parameters are by themselves. These are both
examples of proper multi-line comment blocks.

<H4><span style="color: #9E1010;">Wrong Examples</span></H4>
<pre class ="code">/* testing
   test */</pre>
The */ is not on a line of Its own.
<br>

<pre class="code">/* comment */</pre>
The */ is not on a line of Its own.

<H4>Multiple aliases/events</H4>

You can have multiple aliases/events in one single file but you cannot define an alias/events inside another alias/event.<br>
When you start with an empty script file, you're on the top level, meaning you can add an alias there. Inside that alias, you're not on the top level, you're inside the alias, which can be seen as the level depth '1'. So if you want to add more aliases, always do so on the top level:<br>

<H4><span style="color: #9E1010;">Wrong Example</span></H4>
<pre class ="code">
alias first {

alias second {

}

}
</pre> There the second alias is defined inside the first alias, which is wrong, mIRC will actually try to execute the command /alias, which is a valid command in mIRC to define aliases dynamically.

<br><br><b>Note:</b> these aliases are empty for the sake of the example.

<H4><span style="color: #256B22;">Good Examples</span></H4>
<pre class ="code">
alias first {

}
alias second {

}
</pre> This is correct, the alias second is defined after the first alias, it could also be defined before, the order in which aliases are defined is not important.


<H4>Colors:</H4>
Just like you can add colors when you talk by typing CTRL+K on your keyboard, and then selecting a color number, you can do the same in your aliases. Here is a simple example:

<pre class ="code">alias example {
  echo -a �3This �4is �6a �10cool �15example�1.
}</pre>

<img src="..\images\color_example.png"><br><br>

Will produce:

 <span style="color: #009300;">This</span> <span style="color: #FF0000;">is</span> <span style="color: #9C009C;">a</span> <span style="color: #009393;">cool</span> <span style="color: #D2D2D2;">example</span><span style="color: #009300;">.</span>

<pre class ="code">//echo -a The number �042� is even.</pre>

Will produce the following result:

 The number  is even.

Notice that the number is not showing. That's because it was considered part of the color number '42'. Color index 42 is a shade of yellow, so if the 2nd color code had not been used to reset the colors, the remainder of the line would show in the index 42's shade of yellow instead of showing in red. Prefixing the color value with a zero will fix this issue:

<pre class ="code">//echo -a The number �042� is even.</pre>

Will produce the following result:

 The number <span style="color: #FF0000;">2</span> is even.

<br><b>Note:</b> Most fonts display strange symbols when you press the keys for formatting codes, such as Ctrl+B bold and Ctrl+K color and Ctrl+O. If you want to see these symbols differently in your script editor, search for the font "Fixedsys Excelsior", because it shows these symbols with a small b/c/o inside a black square, though it won't show special symbols for other format codes like Ctrl+R Ctrl+I Ctrl+U. You can change the Font of your scripts editor to be different than the fonts of your channels, and it's usually easier to read code if you choose a non-proportional (fixed) font for the script editor. The "No Liga" version can be downloaded here: http://www.xise.nl/mirc/fsex2p00se3.ttf

<H4>Where do we go from here?</H4>
By now you should be grasping the basics of mSL, or at the very least beginning to understand how things work. It is highly recommended that you take it upon yourself to play around with the code on your own, in order to see what happens when you change different things around.

Next up are the <a href="aliases.html">aliases</a>. If you feel comfortable with aliases, feel free to move on to <a href="variables.html">variables</a>. You can also look at <a href="events.html">events</a>
