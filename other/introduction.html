<H1>Introduction</H1>
<br>
<br>

This article focuses on the very basics of mIRC Scripting. The target audience is people with no knowledge, or very limited knowledge, of the mIRC scripting language.<br>
To be able to understand this, you must be quite familiar with mIRC as an IRC client, its environement, the vocabulary of it such as a status window etc.<br>
When a script is running, it's always running in the context of an active server connection, even if you're not connected, this is why mIRC always start with a status window.<br>
mIRC and therefore all scripts run in a single thread environement and all scripts run in the same 'memory space', meaning that any global naming, like the name of a global variable or an alias, is shared among all scripts.<br>
To avoid conflict with different scripts written by completely different people, it's good practice to use long, explicit, and possibly prefixed with your own script title, names for your alias etc. It's also a good idea to use local aliases.<br>
mIRC scripting has many quirks and exceptions but this introduction will focus on the cores part of what defines mIRC scripting.

<H3>Statements</H3>
Every script is composed of one or more statements. A statement describes something that needs to happen. Each statement must go on its own line, or it must be separated by a pipe, which is the '|' symbol.<br>
If separated by a pipe, the pipe itself must have a space in front and a space after it, otherwise it's not seen as a delimiter of statements.<br>
The first word in a statement is always the name of the statement, what comes after are the parameters for that statement, if any.<br>
All statements' name are composed of ascii letters only and are case insensitive. mIRC scripting as a whole is case insensitive.<br>
We refer to statements by prefixing them with a slash character '/'.<br>
  
For example, the following two are the same:<br><br>
<b>Piping</b>
<pre class ="code">statement 1 | statement 2 | statement 3 | statement 4</pre><br>
<b>Non-piping -- Multiline</b>
<pre class ="code">statement 1
statement 2
statement 3
statement 4</pre>

<h3>Commands statements</h3>

Most statements are called "commands". Commands are performing some operations without returning data to you. mIRC provides a lot of built-in commands to accomplish various tasks.<br>
After a command's name follows the parameters for that command, if any, and they must be spaces separated.<br>
For example if you want to display a line inside a window in mIRC, you would use the <b>/echo</b> command.<br>
mIRC scripting does not use quoted strings, ever, for parameters. Some commands have limited support for quoted string, more about that later.<br>
Some built-in commands result in a verbose message displayed in a window, you can prevent that verbove message from being displayed by prefixing the command with a dot '.', this is called silencing a command (/.echo)<br>
  
<h4>Other statements</h4>
If a statement isn't a command as described above, it's a conditional statement: <b>/if</b>, <b>/elseif</b>, <b>else</b> and <b>/while</b>, they must appear literaly in the code to be recognized as such statement.<br>
If such statement is not literal in the code, it will be executed as a command.<br>
Such statement can involve more syntactic elements with their parameters and are used to control the logical flow of the code, branching, loop etc. They do not split their parameters on spaces.<br>
One exception is the /var statement, which does not split parameters on spaces either but is not a conditional statement. If not literal in the code, /var will produce an error, it won't be executed as a command.
They are also referred to as commands but they are fundamentally different from commands because they don't split parameters on spaces.<br> 

<h4>Routine</h4>
Statements can be executed from the editbox (more about that later) but if you're not executing code from mIRC's editbox, your statements must be part of a routine.<br>
There are two main routines, aliases (your own custom functions) and events (pre-made aliases for you with extras).<br>
In all cases, statements are executed in order one after the other.
  
<H4>Where does the code go?</H4>
All of your routine should go in the Script Editor. To open the script editor press-and-hold the &lt;ALT&gt; key on your keyboard, and then tap the R key (&lt;Alt&gt;+R). Alternatively, you can go to the Tools Menu -> Script editor.<br>
Below is a screen shot of the mIRC Script Editor:<br><br>

<img src="..\images\remote_menu.png"><br><br>

You will notice that there are five selectable tabs: <b>Aliases</b>, <b>Popups</b>, <b>Remotes</b>, <b>Users</b>, and <b>Variables</b>.<br>
Each type of script are stored into different files, an alias file can only have aliases in it, you can have multiple aliases file loaded.<br>
Popups are a special type of script file which describes a popup menu, popups are the contextual menu which appears when you right click some areas like the nicklist.<br>
There are 5 different popups categories: status, channel, query, nicklist, and menubar. <br>
Remote are the type of file which can contain both events and aliases at the same time. You can have multiple remotes file loaded.<br>
Users is for managing access level, while Variables is for storing global variables, only one file can be loaded for both of them.<br>

<h4>Aliases</h4>

Aliases have a name by which we can refer to them and are used to store a list of statement to execute, they usually are used to describe any piece of code that can be reused, but they are also used just as an entry point to start your script.<br>
Once an alias is defined, you can execute it (we also refer to that as calling the alias) by using its name as the first word of a statement, as though it was a command statement.<br>
So, when a statement is executed as a command, if it's not a built-in command, mIRC will look into your aliases for that name and execute your alias if found. If it's not found then mIRC will send that to the IRC server if you are connected or stop the script with an error otherwise.<br>
You can override built-in commands by defining an alias with the same name as of that built-in command, and now executing that name defaults to executing your alias; in this case you can force a script to execute a statement as a built-in command instead of executing the alias by prefixing the statement with a '!' character.<br>
  
They have the following format:
<pre class ="code">alias [-l] &lt;name&gt; &lt;statements&gt;</pre>
If you use a remote file, you must prefix it with the <b>alias</b> keyword, space separated, as shown above.<br>
-l is an optional, spaces separated, parameter indicating that the alias can only be accessed from an alias inside this script file, the alias won't be available from the editbox or a different script file. We call it a local alias.<br>

<pre class ="code">alias fun echo Scripting | echo Is | echo Fun!</pre>

<h4>Remote tab vs Aliases tab</h4>
<br>
<img src="..\images\fun_alias_remote.png">
<img src="..\images\fun_alias_alias.png">
<br>
To call on our alias ''fun'', all we have to do is use its name, preceded by a forward-slash in any mIRC editbox:
<pre class ="code">/fun</pre>
That should print our text:<br><br>
<img src="..\images\hello_edit.png"><br><br>
  
<h4>{ } and group of statements</h4>
<a href="conditional_statements.html">Conditional statements</a> allow you to create branches and loops, where statements only get executed based on a condition.<br>
This means that after a conditional statement, you have a group of one or more statements associated to the condition.
Aliases and events are also entities which associate one or more statements to them; associating a group of statement is done by using a pair of spaced out { } around the statements.<br>
If the context allow it, you can omit using the pair of spaced out { } around the statements:<br>
-For aliases and events, this is when you put all of the statements associated to the alias/event into a single line using pipe to separate the statements (we just did it above for the fun alias). This is because the single line ensures that all statements belong to the alias/event.<br>
-For conditional statement, that's when only a single statement is associated to the condition.<br>
However, using { } allows you to separate your statements using newline instead of a spaced out pipe, which results in cleaner code when grouping statements together.<br>
We usually use newline for each new statement and we usually don't mix piping with newline although it's valid:
<pre class ="code">alias test echo -a test</pre> is equivalent to <pre class ="code">alias test { echo -a test }</pre> the same way <pre class ="code">alias test echo -a test | echo -a test1</pre> is equivalent to <pre class ="code">alias test { echo -a test | echo -a test1 }</pre> which is also equivalent to <pre class ="code">alias test {
  echo -a test | echo -a test1
}</pre> and to <pre class ="code">alias test { echo -a test |
  echo -a test1 }</pre> and to <pre class ="code">alias test { echo -a test
  echo -a test1
  }</pre>

<br><br>
With conditional statement, the { goes after the condition:
<pre class ="code">alias fun if (1 == 1) echo Scripting | if (2 == 3) echo Is | echo = | echo Fun!</pre>
In the example above, the statement 'echo Scripting' belongs to the if (1 == 1) statement. The same is true for 'echo Is' belonging to 'if (2 == 3)', which, however, will not be echoed because the condition 2 == 3 is not true.<br>
Overall, the above example will echo: <pre>Scripting = Fun!</pre>
This is equivalent to:
<pre class ="code">alias fun { if (1 == 1) { echo Scripting } | if (2 == 3) { echo Is } | echo = | echo Fun! }</pre>
and to<br>
  <pre class ="code">alias fun { 
    if (1 == 1) { echo Scripting }
    if (2 == 3) { echo Is }
    echo =
    echo Fun! 
}</pre>
This should help you understand how { } brackets are used.<br><br>

A few notes about the language limitations:

<br><br><span style="color: #DB0000;">The opening bracket " <b>{</b> " <b>must</b> be on the same first line of the alias/event/conditional statement</span>
<br><span style="color: #DB0000;">The opening bracket <b>must not</b> touch anything (space on its left, and space or newline on the right).</span>
<br><span style="color: #DB0000;">The closing bracket <b>must not</b> touch anything (space on its left, and space or newline on the right).</span>
<br><br>
One exception to the above is that for events, the opening bracket will sometimes be touching a ':' character on its left.
<H4><span style="color: #256B22;">Right Examples</span></H4>
<pre class ="code">
  alias example { echo hello! }
  alias example {
  echo hello!
  }</pre>

<H4><span style="color: #9E1010;">Wrong Examples</span></H4>
<pre class="code">alias example{echo hello! }</pre>
The opening bracket is touching "example" and "echo".
<pre class="code">alias example { echo hello!}</pre>
The closing bracket is touching the "hello!".
<pre class="code">alias example
{
  echo hello!
}</pre>
The opening bracket must be on the same line as the "alias" keyword.
  
<h4>Events</h4>
If your statements aren't inside an alias, the other thing they can used with are events.<br>
Events are basically predefined aliases which are called when something happen, such as a nickname joining a channel you're in.<br>
Most of them also have predefined parameters which can be used to quickly filter the triggering of the event.<br>
All events follow this format except two:<br>
<pre class="code">on &lt;event_prefix&gt;&lt;access_level&gt;:&lt;event_name&gt;:&lt;parameter1&gt;:&lt;parameterN&gt;:&lt;statements&gt;</pre>
"on" is literal, event prefix, access level and event name are not evaluated and must be literal.<br>
After that you have the parameters of the events, you can get parameter to be evaluated as the event occurs by using the $() identifier around the parameters.<br>
Some events have more parameters than the others, parameters are all separated by a semi colon ':', so you can't have literal ':' in them.<br>
  
Then you have the ctcp event, it has a similar format as the above and takes two parameters:<br>
<pre class="code">ctcp &lt;event_prefix&gt;:ctcp:&lt;matchtext&gt;:&lt;location&gt;:&lt;statements&gt;</pre>
The last events type are menu events:<br>
<pre class="code">menu &lt;window&gt; {
&lt;statements&lg;
}
</pre><br>
Menu events can be used to describe popups menu definition, which are the contextual menus you get when you right click in Windows, but they also can be used to trigger real events<br>.
Statements in menu events are a bit different than in all other places, if they represent a popup menu, then they will follow the popup menu format, see here.<br>
Otherwise, each statement must go on their own line and are splitted in two on the ':' character, the first part represent a known event name for menu event, while the second part represents statements to execute for that event.<br><br>

For all 3 events type, if all conditions are met, the event 'triggers' and statements are executed the same as with an alias, the { } rules applies if you want to go multiline however, the last ':' character (or the lone : for menu event) can be omitted if you use { }.
  
<H4>Evaluation/Interpretation</H4>

<b></b>$identifier & %variables</b>

Your statement, their parameters, parameters of events, parameters of identifiers themselves and even mIRC options may be composed of $identifier and %variables.<br>

All identifiers starts with dollar symbol sigil '$'.<br>
Generally speaking, identifiers are performing an operation, much like statement, but they return a value, this value can then be used.<br>
mIRC provides a lot of built-in identifiers but when you create aliases, while you can call them as a command, you can also call them as an $identifier.
Identifiers can take parameters as well as one property.
Without any parameter nor any property, the basic syntax is:
<pre class ="code">$name</pre> where name is the name of the identifier.
If they take parameters, they use the ( and ) and a comma to separate arguments, much like other programming language:
<pre class ="code">$name(&lt;argument 1&gt;, &lt;argument 2&gt;, &lt;argument 3&gt;, ...)</pre>
If they take a property, you must use () even if you don't pass parameters, they use a dot '.' at the end after the ')' followed by a known property name:
<pre class ="code">$name(&lt;argument 1&gt;, &lt;argument 2&gt;, &lt;argument 3&gt;, ...).property</pre>

If we want to print out our current nickname, we would use the following code ($me is a built-in identifier returning your nickname):

<pre class ="code">//echo -a $me</pre><br>
If you create an alias of the same name as of an existing built-in identifier, unlike command, mIRC does not call your alias by default, you can prefix your $identifier call with a dot '.' or a slash '/' to force mIRC to call your alias: $/me (if you try that on a non built-in name, the / is included as the name of the identifier to call and it fail).<br>
if you need to use an identifier as plain text you can prefix it with the '!' character: $!5 returns "$5".

%variables works exactly the same way as $identifier with no parameter (and no property) but they return to a value that a script specifically set, which is the simplest way to store data.

<h4>Alias name restriction</h4>
Alias name can be pretty much anything, they can't contain spaces obviously but otherwise can contain any characters (except binary 0), the only restriction is on the first character, which, depending on the context in which you use the alias, can make it fail:<br>
-aliases/statements/identifiers prefixes '.', '!', '~', '/', '!' will all create issues when used in their respective context, aka you have an alias named "~test" and call it as a command without any problem, but calling it as an identifier will be a problem as ~ is an identifier prefix.
-digits, because mIRC has built-in identifiers $1 $2 etc for parameters in aliases and events, again you could call an alias named "1" a command with /1, but you wouldn't be able to use $1.
<h4>Aliases parameters and returning value in $identifier</h4>
When creating aliases, you can access the parameters passed to the alias via the identifiers $1, $2, etc. $1 is the first parameter and so on. You can find more informations about that in the aliases page.
If you plan on returning value from your alias and calling it as an identifier, you can return a value using the /return command.
  
<H4>$rand()</H4>
One of the most common operations we use is to generate random numbers. This is where the <a href="..\identifiers\rand.html">$rand</a> identifier comes into play; it can generate a random number between a given range. The $rand() has the following syntax:

<pre class ="code">$rand(&lt;low&gt;, &lt;high&gt;)</pre>

Given both low bound and high bound number values, $rand will return a random number in between, and including, the two numbers. For example:

<pre class ="code">alias random {
  echo The dice rolled on the floor .... $rand(1, 6)
}</pre>

Here is what we got when we called out /random alias a few times:

<br><br><img src="..\images\random_example.png"><br><br>
The results that mIRC generates for you will be different than the ones listed above in the screenshot; this is the nature of the $rand identifier.

<h4>$+</h4>
An example of an identifier that is a construct and not returning a value is $+, $+ is a concatenation operator, A $+ B results in AB. There is an real identifier version of it, $+(), which does return the concatenated value, $+(A,B,C) is ABC.

<h4>Command vs identifier</h4>

When your statement is a command, regardless of if it's a built-in command or one of your alias, mIRC always applies the same routine.<br>
It first evaluate the statement, by resolving $identifier and %variable, from left to right (parameter of identifier are also resolved from left to right) and then split the resulting line on spaces.<br>
The first word is then the name of the command to call and the rest are the parameter of the command.<br>
What it means is that parameters passed to commands cannot contain spaces:<br
<pre>//echo -ag A B</pre>
if A were representing a string of the form "C D", then it would make B the third parameter of the command instead of the second parameter, and commands rely on parameters number being always the same:
<pre>alias myfunction echo -ag reading line $2 from file $1 on folder C:\
</pre>Suppose myfunction is an alias made to read a line number in a file on disk and you call the alias with <b>/myfunction test.txt 3</b> to read line 3 from C:\test.txt, this would work, $1 is test.txt and $2 is 3.<br>
But when scripting, parameters of functions are most often than not dynamic parameters compared to static value:
<pre>alias myfunction1 return $findfile(C:\,*,1)
</pre>
$findfile is a built-in identifier, here it returns the first file found on C:\<br>
<b>//myfunction $myfunction1 3</b><br>
If the first file found on disk does not contain space, it will work, but if it does, $1 inside the myfunction alias won't represent the complete filename with its spaces, it will only return the first word of it.<br>
Which in turns makes $2 incorrect for the line number parameter 3, and you cannot tell which parameter is the line number as it will depend on how many spaces there's in the filename.
This illustrates how literal spaces (between $myfunction1 and 3 in the command call) and spaces resulting from evaluation (of $myfunction1) are treated equally when it comes to splitting parameters.<br>
In addition, trailing and leading spaces are trimmed and consecutive spaces are shortened to a single space when splitting parameter.<br><br>

This design for command is based on the IRC command format originally, more or less, it's simple, and it will avoid formatting/syntax error when using IRC command or just sending automated messages.
So, basically commands calls are great for functions which don't require parameter or when parameters are known not to be a string, or when the string itself is more or less limited by the context/purpose of that command.<br>
Finally, it's also great if only one of the parameter can be a string and this is how most commands work: the string parameter is the last parameter while parameters which can't contain spaces are coming first. That way, once you have consumed all of the non string parameter, you know that the string starts with the next parameter and goes up to the last parameter.<br>

Maintaining an alias being used as a command by eventually adding new parameters to the alias when you don't know about the type of parameter in advance can be annoying as it requires editing your code carefuly and accordingly for no good reason<br>
So if you need a bit more control about your function or if you don't want to end up being blocked cause you can't add a new parameter, you will want to use $identifier call for your alias instead.
For example if you wanted to do something if the difference in length of two strings are bigger than 5 ($len() is the identifier to return the length of a string):<br>
<pre>alias difflength {
if ($abs($calc($len($1) - $len($2))) > 5) echo -ag difference is bigger than 5.
  }
</pre>
You can't just use a command call like <b>/difflength string1 string2</b> as we just saw how this would fail if any of the string contain spaces, so instead you call it as an identifier $difflength(string1,string2)<br><br>
As we saw, $identifier calls separate arguments with the comma character ',' instead of spaces.<br>
Most built-in identifiers evaluate their parameter from left to right (property included), but some are not evaluating (usually the last) a parameter on purpose.<br>
When you create an alias, if you call it as an identifier, all parameters are evaluated.<br>
When we create such identifier to perform some operation but don't want to do anything with the value returned by the identifier, we use the /noop command (no-operation) which will just evaluate our identifier and do nothing with the result.<br>
It is valid to not use the /noop command:
<pre>alias difflength {
if ($abs($calc($len($1) - $len($2))) > 5) echo -ag difference is bigger than 5.
  }
  alias test {
    $difflength($1,$2)
  }
</pre>with a call $test(string1,string2).<br>
  Here $difflength() is evaluated as the only thing part of the statement and because $difflength does not return a value, the statement become empty and is ignored.<br>
  But if the identifier were returning a value, then that value would become a command call with parameters if any. Building command name dynamically like that not is something that we usually do because it's already more complex and when things get complex, we tend to use identifier call, so we rather do dynamic identifier call in such case.<br>

  Unlike commands call, the literal comma are the only comma separating the argument, the comma which may appear from evaluation are going to be treated as plain text and won't be separating the argument!

  <pre>alias giveme5 return 5
    </pre>In here $giveme5 returns the value 5 so $identifier($giveme5,a,b) would be sending 3 parameters to the $identifier: 5 a and b. But if $giveme5 were to include a comma in its returned value:<br>
  <pre>alias giveme5 return 5,6
    </pre>Then $identifier($giveme5,a,b) would STILL be sending 3 parameters to the $identifier: 5,6 a and b. The comma coming from $giveme5 did not create a 4th parameters.<br><br>
  
  This is what makes identifier much more consistent when handling any kind of data and maintainable
  

  
<H4>What's with the slashes?</H4>
If you asked any script related question in a help channel, you were probably told to type some code that begin with a forward slash. That's because you can execute code (statements) directly in mIRC's editboxes, where you type to chat on IRC.<br>
In order to execute any statements from the mIRC editbox, you must prefix the code with at least one forward slash character '/'.<br>
You cannot execute multiline code from the editboxes, you can only pipe statements.<br><br>
A single slash means that:<br>
-the statement is called as a command, the statement is not evaluated as is the case when the code is executed from the script editor. $identifiers, %variables, the pipe '|' and '{' '}' characters will be plaintext and only a single statement will be executed then, this is meant for quick calling of an alias with static parameters if any.<<br>
-if you try to use a single slash to execute a conditional statement, mIRC will attempt to execute it as an alias if you have one with that name. If you don't, it's sent directly to the IRC server if you are connected, or stops the script execution with an error otherwise.<br>
-the /var statement will report an error instead.<br><br>
  
If you use two slashes, then the everything is as though you were executing statements from the script editor, with the only difference that for security reason, mIRC will prevent you from starting a statement with a %variable or an $identifier.<br>
If two slash are used with more than one statement, you only need them on the first statement.
<H4>Comments</H4>
Comments are normal, readable text that can be placed inside of your script, and they are a good practice to help better explain to other scripters what's going on in your code. Technically speaking, a comment can say whatever you want it to say, and they are ignored when the program is executed, meaning they have no effect on the actual behavior of the code.

<H4>Single-line Comments</H4>
The most basic comment is the single-line comment, which has the following syntax:

<pre class ="code">; This is single-line comment.</pre>

Note on how the comment begins with a semicolon and ends at the end of the line; anything on this line is now ignored.

Here is another basic example of a single-line comment:
<pre class ="code">alias fun {
  ; print "Scripting"
  echo Scripting
  ; print "Is"
  echo Is
  ; print "Fun"
  echo Fun!
}</pre>

<br><img src="..\images\fun_comment.png"><br>

<br><b>Note: </b>The command REM can be used interchangeably with the semicolon. Do not try to comment out a single statement out of multiple statement separated by a pipe.

<H4>Multi-line Comments</H4>
The second type of comment is the multi-line comment. A multi-line comment can, as its name suggests, span multiple lines. Multi-line comments are enclosed between the <b>/*</b> & <b>*/</b> characters. The syntax for a multi-line comment is:

<pre class ="code">
if (/* iswm $1) /
/* This is
  a multi-line
  comment!
*/</pre>
Your text must go between the /* and the */ in order for it to be treated as a comment.<br>

A few notes about the language limitations:
<br>
<br>
<br><span style="color: #DB0000;">Text may touch the opening <b>/*</b> on the right; however, <b>/*</b> must start the line</span>
<br><span style="color: #DB0000;">The closing <b>*/</b> must be on a line of its own</span>
<br>Text is NOT indented unless placed inside curly brackets. The opening brace can be on the same line with the <b>/*</b> and the final comment line isn't indented if there's a closing brace on that line.

<H4><span style="color: #256B22;">Right Examples</span></H4>
<pre class ="code">/* testing
   out
   a multi-line
   comment
*/</pre>
or
<pre class ="code">/*
   testing
   out
   a multi-line
   comment
*/</pre>
In both of the above examples, the opening comment parameters are properly executed,
the lines are spaced out and the closing parameters are by themselves. These are both
examples of proper multi-line comment blocks.

<H4><span style="color: #9E1010;">Wrong Examples</span></H4>
<pre class ="code">/* testing
   test */</pre>
The */ is not on a line of Its own.
<br>

<pre class="code">/* comment */</pre>
The */ is not on a line of Its own.

<H4>Multiple aliases/events</H4>

You can have multiple aliases/events in one single file but you cannot define an alias/events inside another alias/event.<br>
When you start with an empty script file, you're on the top level, meaning you can add an alias there. Inside that alias, you're not on the top level, you're inside the alias, which can be seen as the level depth '1'. So if you want to add more aliases, always do so on the top level:<br>

<H4><span style="color: #9E1010;">Wrong Example</span></H4>
<pre class ="code">
alias first {

alias second {

}

}
</pre> There the second alias is defined inside the first alias, which is wrong, mIRC will actually try to execute the command /alias, which is a valid command in mIRC to define aliases dynamically.

<br><br><b>Note:</b> these aliases are empty for the sake of the example.

<H4><span style="color: #256B22;">Good Examples</span></H4>
<pre class ="code">
alias first {

}
alias second {

}
</pre> This is correct, the alias second is defined after the first alias, it could also be defined before, the order in which aliases are defined is not important.


<H4>Colors:</H4>
Just like you can add colors when you talk by typing CTRL+K on your keyboard, and then selecting a color number, you can do the same in your aliases. Here is a simple example:

<pre class ="code">alias example {
  echo -a �3This �4is �6a �10cool �15example�1.
}</pre>

<img src="..\images\color_example.png"><br><br>

Will produce:

 <span style="color: #009300;">This</span> <span style="color: #FF0000;">is</span> <span style="color: #9C009C;">a</span> <span style="color: #009393;">cool</span> <span style="color: #D2D2D2;">example</span><span style="color: #009300;">.</span>

<pre class ="code">//echo -a The number �042� is even.</pre>

Will produce the following result:

 The number  is even.

Notice that the number is not showing. That's because it was considered part of the color number '42'. Color index 42 is a shade of yellow, so if the 2nd color code had not been used to reset the colors, the remainder of the line would show in the index 42's shade of yellow instead of showing in red. Prefixing the color value with a zero will fix this issue:

<br><b>Note:</b> Most fonts display strange symbols when you press the keys for formatting codes, such as Ctrl+B bold and Ctrl+K color and Ctrl+O. If you want to see these symbols differently in your script editor, search for the font "Fixedsys Excelsior", because it shows these symbols with a small b/c/o inside a black square, though it won't show special symbols for other format codes like Ctrl+R Ctrl+I Ctrl+U. You can change the Font of your scripts editor to be different than the fonts of your channels, and it's usually easier to read code if you choose a non-proportional (fixed) font for the script editor.

By now you should be grasping the basics of mSL, or at the very least beginning to understand how things work. It is highly recommended that you take it upon yourself to play around with the code on your own, in order to see what happens when you change different things around.
