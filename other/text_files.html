<H1>Text Files</H1>
<br>
<br>
Plain text files are files you can edit via a basic editor like notepad and has no special structure. Below are a few handy commands and identifiers to work with plain text files.

<H4>File Info</H4>
To determine if a file exists we can use the $isfile() identifier.

<pre class ="code">$isfile(file.txt)</pre>

In many cases you'd want to check the number of lines in the file. $lines() will help you there.

<pre class ="code">$lines(file.txt)</pre>

<H4>Reading From a Text File</H4>
The $read() identifier is a very powerful command that can be used to read from a text file in a variety of ways.

<H4>n Switch</H4>
By default, $read will evaluate the text it reads as if it was mSL code. To prevent this behavior you must use the n switch. Throughout this article we will ALWAYS use that switch. Improper use of the $read() identifier without the 'n' switch could leave your script <a href="injection.html">highly vulnerable</a>.

<H4>Reading a Random Line</H4>
The most basic functionality $read() offers is the ability to read a random line from a particular file. The syntax is:

<pre class ="code">; read a random line from file.txt
$read(file.txt, n)</pre>

<H4>Reading a Specific Line</H4>
To read a specific line from a file you can specify the line number as the third argument.

<pre class ="code">$read(file.txt, n, line)</pre>

<H4>Searching the File</H4>
$read() offers three methods for searching a file:

<br>Scanner
<br><a href="wildcard.html">Wildcard</a> Pattern
<br>Regular Expression Pattern

<H4>Scanner</H4>
The scanner is the most primitive search of the three. It will go through each line comparing the pattern provided to the first part of the line. If a match is found, mIRC will return the text that followed the pattern.

Consider the following abbr.txt:

<pre class ="code">lol laughing out loud
lmao Laughing my ass off
btw by the way
brb be right back</pre>

We can use the following alias to get the abbreviation we are looking for.

<pre class ="code">alias abbr return $read(abbr.txt, ns, $1)</pre>

Executing the following code:

<pre class ="code">//echo -a $abbr(lol)
//echo -a $abbr(brb)</pre>

Will produce the following output:

<pre class ="code">laughing out loud
be right back</pre>

<H4>Wildcard And RegEx Patterns</H4>
Both the <a href="wildcard.html">wildcard</a> pattern matching and the regex pattern matching works by searching for the first matching line and returning the entire line. It follows the same syntax as the scanner:

<pre class ="code">; A wildcard pattern match:
$read(file.txt, nw, *wildmatch*)

; A regex pattern match:
$read(file.txt, nr, /pattern/)</pre>

<H4>Starting Line</H4>
If you specify a line number after the pattern, that line will be used as the first line to start searching from.

For Example:

<pre class ="code">; Start searching from line 400:
$read(file.txt, nw, *hello*, 400)</pre>

<H4>Iterating Over Matches</H4>
$readn is an identifier that returns the line that $read() matched. We can use that to start searching for our pattern on the next line.

For example, to search all the line containing the word 'test' in a file, we can construct a loop like this:

<pre class ="code">//while ($read(file.txt, nw, *test*, $calc($readn + 1))) echo -a $v1</pre>

In the code above, $readn starts at 0. We use $calc() to start at line 1. Every match $read() will start searching on the next line. When no more matches are after the line specified $read will return $null - terminating the loop.

<H4>Writing to a Plain Text File</H4>
The /write command can be used to manipulate a text file in a variety of ways.

<H4>Appending a Line</H4>
/write's simplest operation is the append operation. By default, /write will write a text line to the end of the file.

<pre class ="code">/write text.txt &lt;string&gt;</pre>

<H4>Inserting a Line</H4>
To insert text at specific line we have the following syntax:

<pre class ="code">/write -il&lt;line&gt; file.txt &lt;text&gt;</pre>

For example, the following line will write "Hello There!" at line 2.

<pre class ="code">/write -il2 file.txt Hello There!</pre>

<H4>Deleting a Line</H4>
The /write command provides the ability to delete a specific line from a file.

<pre class ="code">; Delete line &lt;line&gt; from a file:
/write -dl&lt;line&gt; file.txt</pre>

<H4>Clearing A File</H4>
The -c switch on /write can be combined to clear the file before writing to it.

<pre class ="code">; clear the file
/write -c file.txt</pre>

<H4>Deleting a File</H4>
The delete a file, you can use the /remove command:

<pre class ="code">/remove file.txt
; send to the recycle bin
/remove -b file.txt</pre>
