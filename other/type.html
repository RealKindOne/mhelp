Various commands and identifiers use [type] as a parameter. Below is a list of them:

<pre class ="code">
 0: *!user@host
 1: *!*user@host
 2: *!*@host
 3: *!*user@*.host
 4: *!*@*.host
 5: nick!user@host
 6: nick!*user@host
 7: nick!*@host
 8: nick!*user@*.host
 9: nick!*@*.host
</pre>

You can also specify a type of 10 to 19 which correspond to masks 0 to 9, but instead of using a * wildcard to replace portions of the host, mIRC uses ? wildcards to replace the numbers in the address.

This standard set of masks is also used in other identifiers and commands.
