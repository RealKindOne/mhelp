<br>
Wildcard characters are special characters that are interpreted when comparing text.

There are three meaningful wildcard characters:
<br><b>?</b> - matches a single character
<br><b>*</b> - matches everything (including nothing)
<br><b>&</b> - matches a whole word if used alone

For example the expression "t*s a *?t" matches the string "this is a text"

If & is not used alone it matches the plain text '&' character

'''Note''': It also doesn't match $chr(32) if used to match a whole word, see below

"test &" matches "test this" or "test that"

"test &his" matches only "test &his"

"test thi&" matches only "test thi&"

"test th&s" matches only "test th&s"

"test &" doesn't match "test $chr(32)" (consider $chr(32) to be evaluated here)

Be careful when using the & wildcard character inside /if (and the like: $iif, /while, /elseif) it could be interpreted as the & bitwise operator:

<pre class ="code">if (test & iswm test this)</pre>
is not true because & is used as the bitwise operator, you can use $eval() to force mIRC to read the parameter the way you want:
<pre class ="code">if ($(test &) iswm test this)</pre>

If you need to use any of these special characters as plain text in an expression where they are taken as wildcard character (that is, not always the case for &), you can try to use a {{mIRC|regex|regular expression}} instead.

The number of function/feature of the language supporting wildcard matching is simply too high to make a list, but here are the main usage:

* The iswm operator can be used with /if (and the like) to make a wildcard comparison:
<pre class ="code">
if (test* iswm $1-) { }

While there is a "?" wildcard for 1 character, and a "*" wildcard for zero-or-more characters, there isn't a wildcard for one-or-more characters. However you can obtain the same result by combining the ? and * together. For example, if you have a string where you want to remove leading zeroes, you can do something like:

<pre>//var %a 00000123 | while (0* iswm %a) var %a $mid(%a,2) | echo -a result: %a</pre>

and this will always ensure the string cannot begin with '0'. However, if the input is actually an integer and you do not want to reduce a string of all zeroes to the empty string, you can search for zero followed by 1 wildcard character followed by 0-or-more characters. This causes it to avoid removing a zero when that would be removing the only remaining character.

<pre>//var %a 0000000 | while (0?* iswm %a) var %a $mid(%a,2) | echo -a result: %a</pre>

The iswm operator matches on a case-insensitive basis, but only as far as treating the a-z and A-Z ranges the same, so $upper($chr(233)) and $lower($chr(233)) will be seen as different. If you need to see 'Test' and 'test' as different, then use the iswmcs for a case-sensitive comparison where 'z' and 'Z' are no longer seen as the same.

</pre>
Wildcard-matches can also be used in {{mIRC|$wildtok|token manipulation}}, {{mIRC|$hfind|hash tables}}, {{mIRC|$fline|custom windows}}, {{mIRC|on events|ON events}}, {{mIRC|$var|variables}}, etc. etc.
